# Descrption

This project is a collaboration between EA8DGL Esteban, UA6YKK Alexandr and 
EA7GIB Blas, aiming to create open firmware for the DEEPSDR 101 and BAJEI SDR V5 
clone with the GD32F450 MCU. 

It is currently in the development phase, and programming is being carried 
out primarily using AI. The current version is functional and supports most 
DEEPSDR radio features.

We would welcome any collaboration or assistance with its development. 
Regards.

# DEEPSDR 101 / HTOOL/ BAJEI SDR V5 GD32F450 Open Firmware — Project, 
# Flashing & UI Overview

This document covers three things deliberately kept separate from the
hardware/clock-tree description: what the project is, how to build
and flash it (both the ST-Link/OpenOCD workflow and the vendor
bootloader's `update4.bin` workflow), and exactly how the current menu
system and general UI behave. It reflects the UI/menu state as of
01/09/2026 — several tiles referenced here were added or moved during
that session; if the hardware doc still shows an older 3-page menu
with only a handful of tiles, this file supersedes it for anything
UI-related.

## 1. Project

This is a collaborative, hobbyist, bare-metal firmware project
targeting the GD32F450VET6 MCU used in the DEEPSDR 101 / BAJEI SDR V5
receiver boards — a direct-sampling QSD (Quadrature Sampling Detector)
SDR receiver with an 800x480 touchscreen. No RTOS; direct register
access via GigaDevice's standard peripheral library where it matters
(clocks, DMA, I2S, timers).

The project is in active development, programmed primarily with AI
assistance under the project owner's direction, with real-hardware
verification (oscilloscope, real reception tests) driving essentially
every design decision — nothing in the clock tree, RF chain, or DSP
path is trusted on paper alone; the commit/comment history throughout
the source consistently documents what was actually confirmed on the
bench versus what's still an assumption.

It currently supports AM, USB, LSB, NFM, and WFM reception, a
touch-driven panadapter/waterfall display, a paged settings menu
covering RF/audio/display/digital-mode options, RTTY decoding, and a
growing set of diagnostic and quality-of-life tools (manual/auto AGC,
selectable audio and channel filter widths, spectrum auto-scaling, a
relative S-meter and SNR readout, and a GD32-generated quadrature LO
path for the lowest tuning range where the board's MS5351 clock
generator can't reliably hold quadrature).

## 2. Building and Flashing

### 2.1 Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi openocd
```

### 2.2 Build

```sh
make            # build build/firmware.elf / .hex / .bin
make clean      # remove build artifacts
```

### 2.3 Flashing via ST-Link (OpenOCD)

This is the direct, debugger-based flashing path — used for
development, and for any board with an accessible SWD header.

```sh
make flash      # flash + verify + reset via OpenOCD
make erase      # mass-erase the chip via OpenOCD
```

Both targets use `openocd/gd32f450.cfg` — a **custom** target config,
not the stock `target/stm32f4x.cfg` that ships with OpenOCD. This
matters: the GD32F450's silicon ID makes OpenOCD misdetect it as a
dual-bank 2048KB STM32F42x/43x part, when the real part is a 512KB
single-bank device. Flashing with the wrong target config produces
`Error: checksum mismatch` after programming — if that happens, check
that the custom `.cfg` is actually the one being used, not a stock
STM32F4 profile.

Debugging in VS Code: with the Cortex-Debug extension installed
(suggested automatically via `.vscode/extensions.json`), pressing F5
launches the "Debug GD32F450 (OpenOCD + ST-Link)" configuration
already set up in `.vscode/launch.json`.

### 2.4 Flashing via `update4.bin` (vendor bootloader)

This board ships with a vendor bootloader that expects a specifically
padded and signed update file on external storage (SD card / flash),
rather than a raw `.bin` written at a fixed offset. This is the path
used for a normal user update — no SWD debugger required, useful for
distributing firmware to someone who only has the assembled radio.

```sh
make update4    # pad + sign build/firmware.bin as update4.bin
```

This target pads the built binary and prepends/appends the fixed
magic signature the vendor bootloader's update routine checks for
before it will accept a file — see the `Makefile` for the exact byte
layout and magic value it currently uses. The application itself is
linked to run from `0x08020000`, **not** `0x08000000` — the vendor
bootloader occupies the low part of flash and expects the application
image starting at that offset; `SCB->VTOR` is set explicitly in
`main()` at startup to match, so interrupts vector correctly regardless
of which flashing method was used to get the image onto the chip.

To use `update4.bin`: copy it to wherever the vendor bootloader expects
to find an update image (typically the root of an SD card, or a
specific USB-mass-storage path — this is board/bootloader-specific and
belongs in the hardware doc if not already documented there), then
power-cycle or otherwise trigger the bootloader's update sequence per
the board's own vendor documentation.

### 2.5 Which method to use

- **ST-Link/OpenOCD**: use during development, for any board with an
  accessible SWD header, or when something has gone wrong badly enough
  that the vendor bootloader itself might not be trustworthy (e.g.
  recovering from a bad flash).
- **`update4.bin`**: use for a normal end-user-style update on a board
  that's already running some firmware and boots into its vendor
  bootloader normally — no debugger needed.

## 3. User Interface and Menu System

### 3.1 Screen layout

Landscape 800x480 touchscreen, confirmed on real hardware:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| TOP BAR (h=64): freq (big) | mode | step+vol | time | batt   |
+---------------------------------------------------+----------+
| SPECTRUM (676 wide, 280 tall)                     | RIGHT    |
+---------------------------------------------------+ COLUMN   |
| WATERFALL (672 x 72 rows)                         | S-meter  |
|                                                    | SNR      |
|                                                    | + badges |
+---------------------------------------------------+----------+
| BOTTOM BAR: 6 buttons (MODE VOL STEP NR BANDS MENU)          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Frequency display** (top bar): tapping it opens a numeric keypad
  for direct frequency entry (see 3.5).
- **Spectrum panel**: dragging left/right on it tunes directly,
  quantized to 1kHz steps.
- **Right-hand column**: an S-meter (12-segment, relative/uncalibrated
  dBFS — not a referenced measurement), an SNR readout underneath it
  (derived from the same per-frame FFT data as the panadapter — peak
  bin near the tuned center minus the mean of the rest of the
  spectrum, labeled in dB, not dBm, since the calibration offset a
  real dBm figure would need cancels out in that subtraction), and a
  2x3 grid of status badges below that (AGC profile, BW/audio filter
  width, and other live, at-a-glance state — several of these badges
  are themselves tappable shortcuts to the same setting the matching
  menu tile controls).

### 3.2 Bottom bar

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| MODE  | Opens the demod mode picker (AM/USB/LSB/NFM/WFM) |
| VOL   | Toggles the encoder between TUNE and VOLUME |
| STEP  | Opens the tune-step picker (100Hz-1MHz, 8 entries) |
| NR    | Cycles the AGC profile (OFF/SLW/MED/FST) - same action as tapping the AGC badge in the right column |
| BANDS | Opens the band preset picker |
| MENU  | Opens the settings menu (see 3.4) |

### 3.3 Rotary encoder

Same knob used for tuning doubles as the adjustment control for
whichever target is currently selected:

- **Rotate**: adjusts the current target — frequency by default, or
  whichever setting was last opened via a DETAIL view in the settings
  menu (VOLUME, SQUELCH, BACKLIGHT, SCALE, PGA, SMOOTH, SHIFT, ...).
- **Short press**: cycles the tune step when the target is TUNE,
  toggles which bound (LO/HI) is being adjusted when the target is
  SCALE; no effect for most other targets.
- **Long press**: unconditionally hands the knob back to TUNE and
  closes any open menu/picker screen — the universal "get me out of
  here" gesture, from anywhere.

Manually adjusting SCALE with the encoder automatically turns off
Spectrum AGC if it was on (see 3.4.3) — turning the knob always means
"I'm taking over," never "fight the auto-tracker."

### 3.4 Band / mode / step pickers

Reachable directly from the bottom bar, not nested inside the settings
menu:

- **BANDS** (12 presets, each one tap sets frequency + demod mode +
  tune step together): SW 49M, SW 41M, SW 31M, SW 19M, FM BCST,
  AIRBAND, 2M, VHF HI, 80M, 40M, 20M, 11M (CB).
- **MODE** (5): AM, USB, LSB, NFM, WFM.
- **STEP** (8): 100Hz, 1kHz, 5kHz, 10kHz, 12.5kHz, 25kHz, 100kHz, 1MHz.

### 3.5 Direct frequency entry (numeric keypad)

Tapping the frequency display in the top bar opens a 4x4 numeric
keypad:

```
 1   2   3   DEL
 4   5   6   CLR
 7   8   9
 .   0   KHZ MHZ
```

Type digits, optionally including a decimal point (`.`), then tap
`KHZ` or `MHZ` to apply. This lets a frequency be entered exactly the
way it's normally written — e.g. `14`, `.`, `2`, `0`, `0`, then `MHZ`
for 14.200MHz, or `0`, `.`, `6`, `2`, `1`, then `MHZ` for 621kHz — as
well as the older "plain integer count of the chosen unit" style
(e.g. `146520` then `KHZ` for 146.520MHz). `DEL` removes the last
character typed (including the point, if you backspace onto it);
`CLR` clears the whole entry. There is no bare "Hz" unit button —
entering a frequency out to single-Hz precision digit-by-digit had no
practical use once kHz/MHz entry with a decimal point covered every
realistic case.

### 3.6 Settings menu (MENU button)

A paged tile grid, confined to the panadapter area (the title bar,
S-meter/badges, and bottom bar all stay live and visible underneath):

- **Column 0** (all rows): a fixed page selector — **RADIO / UI / HW /
  DIG** — visually distinct from every option tile, so "switch page"
  reads differently at a glance from "adjust an option." The active
  page is filled solid; the others are outlined.
- **Columns 1-3**: the selected page's own option tiles, up to 9 slots
  (3x3) per page. Bottom-right is always **EXIT**, on every page,
  closing the whole menu.

Some tiles cycle or toggle directly on tap and stay on the grid (you
can tap several in a row without leaving the menu); others open a
full-screen DETAIL view where the encoder adjusts the value live and a
BACK tile returns to the grid.

#### RADIO page (8/8 slots full)

| Tile | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| AGC | cycle | AGC profile: OFF / SLW / MED / FST. OFF genuinely bypasses the demod AGC's peak-tracking (fixed unity gain) rather than just being a very slow setting. |
| SQL | detail | Squelch threshold (AM + NFM) |
| VOL | detail | Volume |
| BW | detail | Audio filter width — **mode-dependent meaning**: 4K0/2K3/1K8 in AM/USB/LSB, but 15K/8K0/4K0 in WFM (same physical control and tile, different filter bank selected underneath depending on the current demod mode) |
| PGA | detail | Codec input gain, 0-47.5dB |
| NR | cycle | Spectral Subtraction noise-reduction strength (AM/USB/LSB only) |
| RFAGC | toggle | RF-level auto-attenuation: automatically steps the codec's input impedance (and backs off PGA) if the front end is overloading |
| ATT | cycle | Manual 3-way codec input attenuator: 0 / -6 / -12dB (10k/20k/40k input impedance) — independent of RFAGC, for deliberately picking a fixed attenuation |

#### UI page (6/6 slots full)

| Tile | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| BL | detail | Backlight brightness |
| SCALE | detail | Spectrum/waterfall dB range (manual LO/HI bounds) |
| SPT | detail | Spatial smoothing passes (spectrum trace) |
| SMH | detail | Frame-to-frame smoothing |
| SPC | cycle | Spectrum trace style: heatmap vs line |
| ZOOM | cycle | Spectrum/waterfall zoom: 1x/2x/4x/8x |

#### HW page (7/8 slots used)

| Tile | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| SPK | toggle | Speaker PA enable/mute |
| IFBW | toggle | WFM's **pre-discriminator** channel filter width: WIDE (96K, i.e. no filter — the full ±96kHz complex Nyquist bandwidth, unfiltered, the original/default behavior) vs NARROW (80K — a real channel filter ahead of the FM discriminator, for adjacent-channel/wideband-noise rejection on a crowded band or a weak station). This is a completely separate control from the BW tile above (which shapes the *demodulated audio*, after the discriminator) — IFBW filters the raw baseband I/Q *before* it. |
| SAGC | toggle | Spectrum/waterfall auto-scale: tracks the display's dB range from the actual incoming spectrum instead of only manual SCALE adjustment. On by default. |
| RATE | toggle | AM/USB/LSB/NFM sample rate: 96K (default) vs 48K. Added as a diagnostic/escape-hatch control for a birdie tied to a harmonic of the sample rate; tapping it forces an immediate live reconfigure if a non-WFM mode is already active, not just on the next mode change. WFM is unaffected either way (always 192kHz). Not persisted across power cycles yet. |
| *(slot 7 free)* | — | reserved |

#### DIG page (3/8 slots used)

| Tile | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| SHIFT | detail | RTTY mark/space tone separation |
| BAUD | cycle | RTTY bit rate |
| INV | toggle | RTTY station NORMAL/REVERSE tone convention (independent of the USB/LSB sideband mirror, which RTTY-L/RTTY-U already handle separately) |
| *(slots 3-7 free)* | — | reserved for future digital modes (PSK31 and similar) |

### 3.7 Notes on tile placement

Several tiles ended up on pages that don't perfectly match their own
"category" (e.g. RF-related IFBW and RATE living on the HW page, or
ATT/RFAGC on RADIO alongside pure DSP settings) — this is a direct
consequence of the RADIO page filling up at 8/8 slots first; new
controls went wherever free slots existed rather than being sorted
by subject. If reorganizing the page layout in the future, be aware
several tiles rely on the shared underlying state (e.g. BW's
mode-dependent relabeling, IFBW/RATE's live-reconfigure-on-tap
behavior) — check each tile's own callback comment in `main.c` before
moving it, since a few have non-obvious side effects tied to exactly
when they run.
