/*
 * Phase 2, rewritten (28/07/2026) from a REAL I2C bus capture of the
 * original, known-working firmware's AIC3204 configuration - not
 * derived, not extrapolated, not guessed. Every write below is a
 * literal (page, register, value) triple exactly as captured on the
 * real bus, in the exact order it was sent, address 0x18 only (the
 * capture also showed unrelated traffic to 0x60 - the MS5351 LO chip
 * on the same bus - filtered out here).
 *
 * The clock chain this reveals is genuinely different from what this
 * driver assumed for a long time: the AIC3204's own PLL is enabled,
 * clocked from BCLK (not from a separate MCLK signal). Confirmed by
 * exact arithmetic against oscilloscope measurements: BCLK=6.144MHz,
 * PLL J=14 (D=0) -> PLL_CLK = 6.144MHz x 14 = 86.016MHz = CODEC_CLKIN.
 * This is why gd32_i2s.c no longer configures an MCLK pin at all - the
 * codec doesn't need one for this design.
 *
 * *** 04/08/2026: Fs 192kHz -> 48kHz *** (per the project owner, to
 * fit the SSB/NR audio ISR back inside its real-time budget - see
 * nr_ss.c's header comment). BCLK/MCLK/PLL above are ALL UNCHANGED -
 * the GD32 is the I2S SLAVE here (see gd32_i2s.h), so WCLK simply
 * BECOMES whatever Fs the codec's own divider chain below produces;
 * nothing about how BCLK itself is generated needed to move. Only the
 * divider chain downstream of the (unchanged) 86.016MHz CODEC_CLKIN
 * changed, and by design as little of it as possible:
 *
 *   ADC: NADC(1) x MADC(28) x AOSR(64) = 1792 -> 86.016MHz/1792 = 48kHz
 *        (was NADC(1) x MADC(7) x AOSR(64) = 448 -> 192kHz - only
 *        MADC changed, x4, matching the x4 Fs drop. AOSR=64 stays
 *        valid: PRB_R1 - the ADC processing block already selected,
 *        unchanged below - supports AOSR 128 or 64 per the TLV320AIC3204
 *        datasheet's Table 2-10 (ADC decimation Filter A), confirmed
 *        against TI's own app-note guidance, not assumed.)
 *
 *   DAC: NDAC(2) x MDAC(7) x DOSR(128) = 1792 -> 86.016MHz/1792 = 48kHz
 *        (was NDAC(2) x MDAC(7) x DOSR(32) = 448 -> 192kHz - NDAC/MDAC
 *        UNCHANGED, only DOSR changed, x4. This ALSO required changing
 *        the DAC processing block itself, from PRB_P17 to PRB_P1: the
 *        old PRB_P17 is DAC "Filter Type C", which TI's own
 *        documentation says is specifically for 192ksps operation
 *        with DOSR=32 - not valid at 48kHz. PRB_P1 is "Filter Type A",
 *        for which TI's guidance is DOSR=(48000/target_fs)*128, which
 *        at target_fs=48000 works out to exactly DOSR=128 - the value
 *        used here. *** PRB_P1 SPECIFICALLY (as opposed to another
 *        Filter-A block, e.g. PRB_P2-P6) is the one part of this
 *        change NOT taken from a real capture or a fully unambiguous
 *        datasheet table read - it's this port's best-supported
 *        inference (PRB_P17's role here is bare pass-through, no
 *        on-chip biquads/AGC/etc - all filtering is done on the GD32
 *        side - and PRB_P1 is Filter A's equivalent "no extra
 *        processing" block). TI's own docs warn that a PRB/AOSR-DOSR
 *        mismatch shows up as "noisy, gain reduced" audio - worth a
 *        careful listen on first boot specifically for that failure
 *        mode before trusting this value long-term.)
 *
 *   BCLK: R30 (page0, reg 0x1E) - "BCLK N Divider" - MISSED entirely in
 *        the first pass of this migration, found by the project owner
 *        via a real oscilloscope measurement: BCLK read 6.144MHz (the
 *        OLD 192kHz-correct value, 192000*32) instead of the expected
 *        1.536MHz (48000*32 for 16-bit stereo), even though WCLK
 *        correctly read 48kHz. This divider runs off DAC_CLK
 *        (=CODEC_CLKIN/NDAC=86.016MHz/2=43.008MHz, confirmed by
 *        reverse-fitting the OLD captured N=7 against the OLD measured
 *        6.144MHz: 43.008MHz/7=6.144MHz exactly) - a path independent
 *        of the NADC/MADC/AOSR and NDAC/MDAC/DOSR dividers above, so
 *        changing those never touched this one. Fixed the same way as
 *        MADC: N=7 -> N=28 (same x4 as everywhere else), giving
 *        43.008MHz/28=1.536MHz=32*48kHz exactly.
 *
 * The ADC input routing (P1_R52/54/55/57) and ADC power-up (R81/R82)
 * already matched this capture exactly even before this rewrite - so
 * those were never the bug. Registers 8/9/44/46 (pages, not
 * addresses) further down are DRC/biquad filter coefficients (audio
 * processing, not core bring-up) - included for completeness since
 * they're genuinely part of the real sequence, not because their
 * exact function has been analyzed here.

 * slave_192k() enables the GD32's I2S peripherals BEFORE the codec
 * ever outputs real BCLK/WS (those don't exist until aic3204_phase2_
 * init()'s PLL/divider writes land) - the GD32 slave is listening from
 * the very first real clock edge. On a live switch, the OLD order was
 * backwards: the codec's full reconfigure (BCLK/WS resuming partway
 * through it, well before the sequence returns) happened BEFORE
 * sdr_rx_start()/gd32_i2s_stream_start()'s disable/re-enable of the
 * GD32 side - so the GD32 peripheral re-enables into an ALREADY-
 * RUNNING clock at an arbitrary phase, not from a clean first edge.
 * main.c's apply_demod_mode() now calls this reset (codec falls
 * silent - no BCLK/WS) FIRST, then re-enables/arms the GD32 side
 * WHILE the codec is still silent, and only THEN calls aic3204_
 * configure_rate() below to bring BCLK/WS back - reproducing the cold

 * *** 05/08/2026, refactored for the WFM FERR investigation *** -
 * this used to be aic3204_phase2_init() alone, called ONCE at cold
 * boot, hardcoded to whatever the default rate was at the time (48kHz
 * then, 96kHz now). Live rate switches (aic3204_set_rate_
 * registers()) used a much smaller, separate register set that only
 * touched the divider chain (MADC/DOSR/PRB/BCLK-N) and power-cycled
 * ADC/DAC - it never re-ran the software reset (R1=0x01) or anything
 * upstream of the dividers (PLL config, page 1 analog bias/routing,
 * MIC_PGA, the DRC/biquad coefficient banks). Real hardware logs
 * showed a from-cold WFM boot (this same 192kHz register set, but via
 * a full reset) runs with ZERO SPI_STAT_FERR for as long as no rate
 * switch happens - the moment a LIVE switch occurs (in either
 * direction), FERR starts firing continuously and, critically, NEVER
 * clears again even switching back to a mode that was clean moments
 * before, on either RX or TX (they always match exactly, since they
 * share WS/CK). That rules out the PCB/signal-integrity theory
 * entirely (same wiring, same rate, works perfectly from cold) and
 * points at some persistent internal state the small register subset
 * doesn't reset.
 *
 * *** Second finding, same investigation ***: even adding a genuine
 * hardware nRESET pulse (aic3204_rate_switch_reset() above) - the
 * exact same reset cold boot uses - to a live switch did NOT clear
 * FERR either. That rules the codec itself back OUT again: it reaches
 * an identical state on both paths now, so this function alone isn't
 * the fix - see aic3204_rate_switch_reset()'s comment for where the
 * remaining difference is believed to be (GD32-side enable ordering),
 * which is why the reset call was pulled OUT of this function and
 * into its own step, called separately, with the GD32 I2S resync
 * sandwiched in between it and this one - see main.c's apply_demod_
 * mode().
 *
 * This function is now just the register configuration itself
 * (parameterized by rate), assuming the caller already reset the
 * codec via aic3204_rate_switch_reset() (or, for cold boot, via
 * aic3204_phase2_init() calling both in sequence below). Leaves
 * ADC/DAC powered OFF at the end - aic3204_set_rate_power_up() turns

 * --- Live rate switch (05/08/2026, for WFM's 192kHz reactivation;
 * *** REWRITTEN 05/08/2026, THIRD pass *** - split into separately
 * callable steps instead of one function, so main.c can sandwich the
 * GD32 I2S resync in between the reset and the register configuration
 * - see aic3204_rate_switch_reset()'s comment for the full reasoning
 * on why the ORDER of codec-reset vs GD32-resync turned out to matter,
 * not just whether the codec gets reset at all) ---
 *
 * HISTORY, briefly: the ORIGINAL live-switch code reprogrammed only
 * the handful of registers that differ between rates, leaving the PLL
 * and everything else untouched - measurably got the right sample
 * rate (confirmed on scope) but left SPI_STAT_FERR firing continuously
 * after every switch, on both RX and TX, forever. Wrapping the SAME
 * full register sequence cold boot uses (software reset first) helped
 * nothing. Upgrading that to a genuine hardware nRESET pulse - the
 * literal same reset cold boot performs - ALSO helped nothing: real
 * hardware logs showed FERR still firing at essentially the same rate
 * (hundreds per check window) even though the codec now reaches an
 * IDENTICAL state on both paths. That ruled the codec back out and
 * pointed at the GD32 side's enable ORDER relative to the codec's
 * clock output - see aic3204_rate_switch_reset()'s comment for the
 * theory and the reordering this led to.
 *
 * There is no longer a single "aic3204_set_rate_registers()" call for
 * this - main.c's apply_demod_mode() now calls, in order:
 *   1. aic3204_rate_switch_reset()   - codec falls silent, no BCLK/WS
 *   2. sdr_rx_reconfigure() / gd32_i2s_stream_reconfigure()
 *   3. sdr_rx_start() / gd32_i2s_stream_start() - GD32 I2S resync +
 *      DMA armed, all while the codec is STILL silent
 *   4. aic3204_configure_rate(rate)  - NOW bring BCLK/WS back, with
 *      the GD32 side already listening from the first real edge
 *   5. aic3204_set_rate_power_up()   - ADC/DAC on, real samples flow
 */

/*
 * Powers the DAC/ADC channels back UP - call this AFTER the RX/TX DMA
 * is already armed for the new rate (see main.c's apply_demod_mode()),
 * so real samples never arrive faster than they're drained.
 *
 * *** 05/08/2026, changed from a blind 50ms delay to the SAME ADC-
 * ready polling loop aic3204_phase2_init() always used at boot ***:
 * now that every live switch runs a genuine hardware reset on
 * EVERY live switch (not just once at cold boot), every switch is a
 * genuine fresh PLL lock, not a "re-lock from an already-running
 * state" - the earlier "first switch needs 50ms, later ones don't"
 * reasoning (see git history/transcript if this comment's prior
 * version is needed) no longer applies cleanly, since there's no
 * meaningful difference between "first" and "later" switches anymore
 * - they're all effectively first switches now. Polling the real ADC
 * Flag Register (0x24) instead of guessing a fixed delay is the more
 * correct match for that: it waits exactly as long as the hardware
 * actually needs, up to the same ~200ms ceiling phase2_init() already
 * used at boot, rather than hoping 50ms is enough on every switch

 * layout in this codebase (see the "(captured)" comments on it in
 * aic3204_phase2_init() - nobody has decoded its exact dB mapping
 * yet), and getting it wrong risks driving the headphone amp harder
 * than intended. The digital DAC volume is the well-documented,
 * predictable, safe control to expose first; if +24dB of digital
 * headroom on top of the analog stage still isn't enough, that's the
 * next place to look.

/*
 * Input impedance / Rin selector (Page 1, R52/R54/R55/R57) - added
 * 07/08/2026, per the project owner, after the datasheet's "Analog
 * PGA versus Input Configuration" table (2.3.2.1) turned up something
 * useful for the RF-level auto-AGC (see main.c's rf_agc_poll()):
 * choosing Rin=20k or 40k instead of the captured baseline's 10k
 * shifts the WHOLE PGA gain range down by 6dB/12dB respectively
 * (10k: 0..47.5dB, 20k: -6..41.5dB, 40k: -12..35.5dB, single-ended) -
 * a coarse attenuation option that reaches BELOW what the PGA's own
 * 0dB floor can do alone, for when even that isn't enough backoff on
 * a genuinely blowtorch-strong local signal.
 *
 * *** IMPORTANT UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION *** - aic3204_phase2_init()'s
 * captured 10k values (P1R52/P1R54 = 0x10, P1R55/P1R57 = 0x04) are
 * real, sniffed-from-hardware bytes (see the comment right above
 * those wr() calls for the full field decode). The 20k/40k values
 * THIS function writes are NOT captured - they're inferred from the
 * datasheet's standard 2-bit field encoding (00=off, 01=10k, 10=20k,
 * 11=40k), applied to the SAME field position the captured 10k byte
 * already uses in each register (bits[5:4] for P1R52/P1R54, bits[3:2]
 * for P1R55/P1R57 - matching how 0x10 decodes to "bits[5:4]=01" and
 * 0x04 decodes to "bits[3:2]=01" respectively). This is a reasonable,
 * standard-encoding inference, not a guess pulled from nowhere - but
 * it has NOT been confirmed against a real I2C capture the way
 * everything else in this file has. Test on real hardware before
 * trusting it blind: tune to a known strong signal, step through
 * AIC3204_RIN_10K/20K/40K, and confirm both channels stay balanced
 * (equal I/Q amplitude - see the WFM gain-chain investigation for how
 * to check that from the raw min/max debug prints) and the effective
 * attenuation roughly matches the datasheet's 6dB/12dB steps. If a
 * real capture ever turns up different bytes for 20k/40k, THAT'S the
 * ground truth - fix this function's field values to match, not the
 * other way around.
 *
 * Left/right (I/Q) channels are ALWAYS switched together, same
 * atomic call - see the WFM gain-chain investigation for why an
 * asymmetric change here would introduce a real I/Q balance problem
 * (degraded SSB image rejection), not just a level mismatch.
 *
 * Unlike aic3204_set_pga_gain_db()'s soft-stepped gain register, this
 * reconnects the input MUX itself - the datasheet doesn't document
 * soft-stepping for these registers, so treat this as an abrupt,
 * audible-if-unmuted transition, NOT something to call on every fine
 * adjustment. Callers should mute (demod_am_reset_diag() or
 * demod_wfm_reset_diag(), whichever matches the active mode) around
 * any call to this - see rf_agc_poll()'s rin escalation for the
 * pattern.
