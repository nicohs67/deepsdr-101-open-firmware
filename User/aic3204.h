 * TLV320AIC3204 codec driver.
 *
 * The AIC3204 organizes its registers into "pages": register 0x00 on
 * ANY page is the "Page Control Register" - writing it selects the
 * active page, and reading it always returns the currently selected
 * page. This gives a free closed-loop test to validate the I2C link
 * without touching any audio register: write a page, read it back,
 * and it must match.
 *
 * I2C address: defaults to 0x18 with the AIC3204's MODE pin tied to
 * ground (the most common breakout configuration), or 0x19 if tied to
 * VDD. If aic3204_init() doesn't detect 0x18, use aic3204_scan_bus()
 * to find the real address before assuming the chip isn't responding.

 * Phase 2 init: the AIC3204's clock/PLL, ADC input routing, and ADC
 * power-up, ported byte-for-byte (138 register writes, exact order)
 * from a REAL I2C bus capture of the original, known-working
 * firmware's own configuration of this same codec on this same board
 * - not derived, not extrapolated, not guessed.
 *
 * This capture revealed the actual clock architecture: the AIC3204's
 * own PLL is enabled, clocked from BCLK (not a separate MCLK signal).
 * Confirmed by exact arithmetic against oscilloscope measurements:
 * BCLK=6.144MHz, PLL J=14/D=0 -> PLL_CLK=86.016MHz=CODEC_CLKIN, which
 * both the ADC (NADC=1/MADC=28/AOSR=64) and DAC (NDAC=2/MDAC=7/DOSR=128)
 * divider chains reduce to exactly Fs=48kHz (was MADC=7/DOSR=32 ->
 * 192kHz before 04/08/2026 - see aic3204_phase2_init()'s header
 * comment for the full story, including the DAC processing-block
 * change that had to come with it). See gd32_i2s.c - no MCLK pin is
 * configured at all now, since the codec doesn't need one for this
 * design.
 *
 * Call this after aic3204_probe_and_reset() AND after the I2S side is
 * already generating a real clock towards the codec
 * (gd32_i2s_init_slave_192k already executed) - phase 2 configures
 * clock registers that depend on BCLK/WCLK already running.
 *
 * `rate` parameterizes the cold-boot rate itself - added 01/09/2026
 * so main() can boot directly into AIC3204_RATE_192K when the saved
 * config's last mode was WFM, instead of always cold-booting at 96K
 * and immediately following up with a second, WARM apply_demod_mode()
 * switch into WFM. See main()'s boot sequence comment for the full
 * "double reset" reasoning this closes - every OTHER caller/scenario
 * (any non-WFM saved mode, or no saved mode at all) still passes
 * AIC3204_RATE_96K here, unchanged from this function's old
 * no-parameter behavior.

 *      reinit instead of live resync" rewrite *** - a FULL teardown/
 *      rebuild of SPI1/I2S1_ADD for the new rate (spi_i2s_deinit(),
 *      PLLI2S reconfigure, i2s_init(), GPIO AF replay), the same

 *      silence. See gd32_i2s.c's own comment for why this replaced the
 *      earlier partial-resync approach.

 *      else aic3204_phase2_init() originally set (analog routing,

 *      now fully configured for the new rate. ADC/DAC left powered

 *      (sdr_rx.h/gd32_i2s.h) - arms BOTH DMA channels at the new block
 *      size. SPI1/I2S1_ADD are already freshly enabled from step 3, so
 *      no separate resync is needed here anymore.
 *   6. aic3204_start_bclk_wclk(rate) - NOW, and only now, BCLK/WCLK go
 *      live (R30 then R27) - the GD32 side is already listening at
 *      this point, so this is the first real edge it sees.
 *   7. aic3204_set_rate_power_up() - ADC/DAC start producing real
 *      samples at the new rate, straight into an already-armed DMA
