 * VBAT monitoring via the GD32F450's built-in ADC0 channel 18. Per
 * gd32f4xx_adc.h's ADC_SYNCCTL_VBATEN comment ("channel 18 (1/4
 * voltage of external battery) enable of ADC0") and the GD32F450
 * datasheet's ADC chapter, enabling that switch internally routes
 * VBAT/4 onto channel 18 - the 1/4 divider is built into the ADC
 * peripheral itself, not a board-level resistor network, so
 * battery_get_millivolts() below undoes it (raw_adc_mV * 4) as part
 * of the conversion.
 *
 * DIODE DROP COMPENSATION (per the project owner, 31/07/2026): this
 * board's VBAT pin sits behind a series diode from the actual battery
 * terminals - a common reverse-polarity/back-feed protection on
 * battery inputs - so the pin itself reads LOWER than the real
 * battery voltage by that diode's forward drop. BATTERY_DIODE_DROP_MV
 * (700mV, a typical silicon diode Vf) is added back on top of the *4
 * result to approximate the actual battery terminal voltage.
 *
 * This is a FIXED approximation, not a measured/temperature-
 * compensated Vf - real diodes drop somewhat less at low current and
 * more at high current or low temperature, so treat the result as
 * "close enough for a gauge", not a calibrated instrument. If it
 * reads consistently off against a multimeter on the actual battery
 * terminals, retune BATTERY_DIODE_DROP_MV - the ADC/divider math
 * above is exact per the datasheet, the diode drop is the only fudge
 * factor in this file.
