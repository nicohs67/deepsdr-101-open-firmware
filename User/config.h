/*
 * config.h - centralized runtime-tunable parameters.
 *
 * Added 07/08/2026, per the project owner: this project's usual style
 * is "constant lives right next to what it configures, with a comment
 * explaining why" (see e.g. AM_SETTLE_MUTE_BLOCKS in demod_am.c, or
 * MENU_TILE_GAP in main.c) - good for understanding WHY a value is
 * what it is once you've found it, bad for finding it in the first
 * place across several thousand-line files if you don't already know
 * where to look. That style is UNCHANGED and stays the primary
 * source of truth for most things - screen geometry, colors, DSP
 * filter coefficients, and so on all stay exactly where they were.
 *
 * This file exists ONLY for the handful of values someone is actually
 * likely to want to tweak without reading a DSP comment first: what
 * the radio boots into, and how aggressively the RF-level auto-AGC
 * reacts. If you're looking for something NOT in this file, it's
 * still living next to its own explanation somewhere in main.c,
 * demod_am.c, or aic3204.c - grep for it, the comment there will
 * explain the tradeoffs a one-line #define here can't.
 *
 * Each #define below still only has ONE real owner (the .c file that
 * actually declares the variable/uses the value) - this file supplies
 * the NUMBER, the owning file supplies the explanation of what it
 * does and why that number, via a comment pointing back here or vice
 * versa. Search for the CONFIG_* name to find every place it's used.
