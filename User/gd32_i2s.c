 * *** 05/08/2026, generalized from gd32_i2s_init_slave_192k() for the
 * "full reinit instead of live resync" rewrite ***
 *
 * HISTORY: every earlier attempt at a LIVE rate switch tried to keep
 * SPI1/I2S1_ADD's existing configuration and just nudge them back into
 * sync - a plain disable/re-enable of I2SEN (sdr_rx_resync_spi()'s and
 * gd32_i2s_stream_start()'s old approach), or reordering that against
 * the codec's own reset/reconfigure. Real hardware logs kept finding
 * the SAME result no matter which of those was tried: FERR starts
 * firing after a live switch and NEVER clears again, even switching
 * back to a rate that was clean moments earlier - while running a
 * given rate from a genuine COLD BOOT (this same function, called
 * once from main.c before the main loop starts) is rock solid, FERR
 * always 0, indefinitely.
 *
 * That gap - cold boot always clean, live switch never fully clean -
 * means something LIVE switching left touched (PLLI2S's own state,
 * SPI1/I2S1_ADD's internal shift/frame counters, or some combination)
 * that a bare I2SEN toggle doesn't reset, even though every DIRECTLY
 * READABLE register looks identical either way. Rather than keep
 * chasing which specific bit that is, this function is now called on
 * EVERY rate change (cold boot AND live), doing the FULL teardown/
 * rebuild cold boot always did: spi_i2s_deinit(SPI1) (which also
 * clears I2S1_ADD's extension state, since it's the same peripheral
 * instance), a full PLLI2S off/reconfigure/on/wait-for-lock, and a
 * full i2s_init()/i2s_full_duplex_mode_config() + GPIO AF replay - not
 * just re-enabling what was already configured. Slower (a few hundred
 * microseconds of extra I2C-scale bring-up, irrelevant next to the
 * WFM_SETTLE_MUTE_BLOCKS-sized silence a mode switch already has), but
 * this is the ONLY sequence that's ever measured clean on real
 * hardware - see main.c's apply_demod_mode() for where this now sits
 * in the full switch sequence.

 * *** BUG FOUND AND FIXED 04/08/2026 - THIS is almost certainly what
 * the project owner heard as a high-pitched hiss, a "repeating
 * pattern", and general slowdown right after the 48kHz migration ***
 *
 * This was previously a HAND-COPIED literal `512U`, with a comment
 * literally saying "MUST equal SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES" - a manually
 * maintained invariant, not an enforced one. When SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES
 * dropped from 512 to 128 (see sdr_rx.h's own comment) for the 48kHz
 * move, THIS constant was never touched, because nothing forced it to
 * be. The result: gd32_i2s_stream_write_half() below copies
 * STREAM_WORDS_PER_HALF (1024 int16 words, derived from the STALE
 * 512) from whatever buffer the caller passes it - but demod_am.c's
 * s_audio_out[] is only SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES*2 = 256 words long now.
 * Every single call read 768 words PAST THE END of s_audio_out[] -
 * whatever static memory happens to sit after it in the linker layout
 * - and played that garbage out the DAC alongside the real 256 words
 * of audio. That's a textbook explanation for all three symptoms:
 * hiss/noise (reading unrelated memory as PCM), a "repeating pattern"
 * (that adjacent memory's own contents are fairly static from block
 * to block), and it plausibly contributing to the reported slowdown
 * too (see gd32_i2s_stream_write_half()'s DMA-position math below,
 * which was also computing on the wrong buffer geometry).
 *
 * FIX: reference SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES (sdr_rx.h) directly instead of
 * hand-copying it - this file now has ONE source of truth for the
 * frame count, and it can never silently drift out of sync with the
 * actual RX block size again, the way the plain literal just did.
 *
 * --- TX audio stream (demodulated audio -> DAC) ---------------------
 *
 * A 2-half ping-pong buffer played by the same circular DMA channel
 * (DMA0/CH4) that the silence/test-tone paths use. Each half holds
 * exactly one RX block's worth of stereo frames: since RX and TX are
 * clocked by the SAME codec-driven BCLK/WS at the same rate, every
 * completed RX half corresponds to exactly one TX half consumed -
 * the two sides cannot drift, only the phase offset at startup
 * varies, and gd32_i2s_stream_write_half() re-derives the safe half
 * from the live DMA position on every call, so it self-corrects.
