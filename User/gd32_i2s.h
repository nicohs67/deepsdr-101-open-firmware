/*
 * I2S1 (SPI1) peripheral configuration for the GD32F450, SLAVE mode,
 * full-duplex (main I2S1 block + I2S1_ADD extension block), for
 * 192kHz stereo I/Q with the AIC3204 codec.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (28/07/2026, corrected): a real I2C bus capture of the
 * original firmware's AIC3204 configuration shows register 0x1B=0x0C,
 * which sets BCLK and WCLK as OUTPUTS on the codec (confirmed against
 * a real TI forum example using this exact byte, and TI's SLAA404C
 * app note describing bits D3:D2 of this register as the BCLK/WCLK
 * direction control) - the codec is the I2S MASTER in this design,
 * not a slave. The GD32 must be configured as SLAVE to match. Running
 * both sides as master at the same time caused real, observed bus
 * contention on a real oscilloscope (BCLK/WCLK with irregular,
 * non-uniform pulse widths).
 *
 * STILL PENDING: MCLK is not generated at all right now. With the
 * codec expecting to be master, it needs a real MCLK to lock its own
 * PLL and generate a stable BCLK/WCLK - without it, expect BCLK/WCLK
 * to still be unstable even with the master/slave roles now correct.
 * This MCU's native I2S MCKOUT block can't produce the board's real
 * MCLK:BCLK:Fs ratio (8:32:1, fixed at 256x/32x instead) - the plan is
 * a general-purpose timer (TIMER2_CH0 on PC6 is available as an
 * alternate function on this pin) generating an independent 1.536MHz
 * square wave, pending confirmation of the exact AF number for that
 * function on this specific pin.
 *
 * Note: on this chip/board, the pins below belong to SPI1/I2S1, NOT to
 * SPI2/I2S2 - double-check this if porting from an STM32F4 reference,
 * since peripheral numbering on these specific pins differs.
 *
 * Pins (confirmed on real hardware):
 *   PB12 = WS   (I2S1_WS)        AF5 (now an INPUT - codec drives it)
 *   PB13 = BCLK (I2S1_CK)        AF5 (now an INPUT - codec drives it)
 *   PB15 = DOUT (I2S1_SD, TX)    AF5
 *   PB14 = DIN  (I2S1_ADD_SD,RX) AF6 (confirmed against the datasheet's
 *                                     Port B alternate function table -
 *                                     AF5 on this pin is SPI1_MISO, a
 *                                     different peripheral entirely)

/*
 * NOTE (04/08/2026): despite the name, this now brings up the I2S
 * peripheral for 48kHz, not 192kHz - see gd32_i2s.c's own comment on
 * why the function itself needs almost no change for the Fs move (the
 * GD32 is the I2S SLAVE; the codec's own divider chain, in aic3204.c,
 * is what actually sets Fs). Left un-renamed today to keep this
 * change's diff contained to what actually needed to move, not
 * because the name is still accurate - a rename is a reasonable
 * follow-up, just a separate one.
