 * --- Settings menu screen (first pass, extended with real detail
 *     views 31/07/2026) -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Added 31/07/2026: a SEPARATE ui_screen_t, not more widgets crammed
 * into s_demo_screen - the framework already supports this (ui_screen_t
 * is just a widget registry + dispatcher, see ui.h, no assumption
 * anywhere that only one screen exists). MENU now OPENS this screen
 * (menu_screen_open()) instead of cycling s_encoder_target through
 * BACKLIGHT/SCALE/SQUELCH - see demo_button_callback()'s MENU branch
 * for what that replaces.
 *
 * TWO LEVELS inside this one screen:
 *   - GRID (menu_grid_show()): the 4x2 tile overview - tapping
 *     AGC/SPT acts immediately (cycles/toggles in place, same as
 *     before); tapping SQUELCH/BACKLIGHT/SCALE/VOLUME/SMOOTH now
 *     opens...
 *   - DETAIL (menu_detail_show()): a single big value + a BACK tile,
 *     replacing what used to be "select the target and bounce back to
 *     the main screen to see it change" - per the project owner, that
 *     wasn't REAL interaction (you couldn't see the value change from
 *     inside the menu at all). Turning the knob now updates the big
 *     value live, right here - see settings_value_redraw()'s comment
 *     for how tune_encoder_poll() knows which view to repaint.
 *
 * CONFINED to the spectrum+waterfall panel (MENU_AREA_*, see
 * menu_grid_show()), not a full-screen takeover - changed 31/07/2026,
 * again per the project owner: the top bar, right column, and bottom
 * button bar now stay live and touchable the ENTIRE time the menu is
 * open, only the graph area gets replaced by the tile grid (or a
 * detail view). This means TWO screens are effectively active at
 * once, split by SCREEN REGION rather than by which one is "current":
 *   - demo_touch_poll() routes each touch sample to s_menu_screen if
 *     it lands inside MENU_AREA while s_menu_open, otherwise always to
 *     s_demo_screen (see its own comment for the accepted drag-across-
 *     the-boundary edge case).
 *   - sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick() keeps the S-meter and time readout
 *     updating every frame regardless of s_menu_open (both live in the
 *     still-visible top bar/right column) but skips the FFT-averaging/
 *     smoothing/spectrum_draw()/waterfall work while the menu covers
 *     that panel - see its own comment for exactly where that split
 *     happens.
 *   - menu_screen_close() only needs to restore the spectrum+waterfall
 *     PANEL BORDERS (ui_panel_draw() on s_spectrum_panel/
 *     s_waterfall_panel) - everything else was never touched, so a
 *     full radio_screen_draw() would just be wasted EXMC bandwidth and
 *     a visible flash of things that never changed. The actual trace/
 *     waterfall CONTENT follows on the next tick's frame, ~33ms later
 *     at most - imperceptible.

 * two entries ADD on top is switching rtty_get_enabled() on and
 * setting mark/space for the correct polarity (see
 * menu_mode_preset_callback()'s rtty_variant handling right below).
 *
 * The polarity difference is real, not a firmware quirk: USB and LSB
 * are mirror images of each other in frequency for the same pair of
 * RF tones, so whichever audio tone is "mark" in one becomes "space"
 * in the other at the same nominal Hz - confirmed by the project
 * owner needing to flip the transmitter's own inversion setting to
 * get a clean decode in USB after LSB worked normally. RTTY_VARIANT_
 * INVERTED swaps CONFIG_RTTY_MARK_HZ/SPACE_HZ's roles for exactly

 * range (TUNE_MIN_HZ/MAX_HZ above), each bundling a starting
 * frequency + demod mode + tuning step into one tap. Frequencies are
 * reasonable STARTING POINTS inside each band, not band-EDGE
 * markers - picked to land on something likely to have activity, not
 * necessarily the technical bottom of the allocation.
 *
 * SW BROADCAST (49m/41m/31m/19m): AM, 5kHz step (standard SW
 * broadcast channel spacing). Only 4 of the many SW broadcast bands -
 * a reasonably representative spread across the HF spectrum, not an
 * exhaustive list; easy to add more entries the same way.
 * FM BCST (commercial FM broadcast): WFM, 100kHz step, 88.0MHz - the
 * bottom of the commercial FM band almost everywhere.
 * AIRBAND (civil aviation voice): AM - aviation voice is AM, not FM,
 * unlike everything else in this table - 25kHz step (the simpler,
 * widely-used channel spacing; some regions use 8.33kHz instead,
 * not offered here as a separate step yet).
 * 2M (amateur 2 meter band): NFM, 12.5kHz step (standard repeater/
 * simplex channel spacing in most of Europe).
 * VHF HI: NFM, 12.5kHz step, 150.0MHz - a general "above 2m, below
 * the 180MHz ceiling" catch-all (marine VHF, PMR, and similar narrow-
 * band VHF traffic live in this general region) rather than one
 * specific named allocation - the vaguest entry here, worth revisiting
 * once you know what you actually want to listen to up there.
 *
 * 80M/40M/20M (amateur HF, added 02/08/2026): LSB below 10MHz, USB
 * above - the standard amateur-radio sideband convention, not an
 * arbitrary choice per band. 1kHz step (BAND_STEP_1K) for SSB tuning
 * precision - the 5/25kHz broadcast/aviation steps above would be far
 * too coarse to sit on a voice QSO here. Frequencies are common phone-
 * segment calling/activity spots, not band edges: 80M 3.750MHz (IARU
 * R1 SSB calling area), 40M 7.150MHz (R1 voice segment, comfortably
 * inside 7.130-7.200), 20M 14.250MHz (a generally busy R1/R2 SSB
 * spot).
 * 11M (added 02/08/2026): technically CB, NOT an amateur allocation
 * anywhere today (it was, decades ago, in some countries - hence
 * still being lumped in with "ham bands" colloquially) - included
 * anyway per the project owner's request. 27.185MHz is CB channel 19,
 * historically the most active AM calling channel (truckers). AM,
 * 10kHz step (BAND_STEP_10K) - the actual 40-channel CB spacing.

/*
 * --- RF-level (analog PGA) auto-AGC -------------------------------------
 *
 * Added 07/08/2026, per the project owner, after ruling out the
 * digital AM/SSB AGC's own math as the cause of "señales muy fuertes
 * saturan la radio del todo" (see demod_am.c's AGC comment - instant
 * attack, no lower gain clamp, mathematically fine for any input
 * short of the ADC itself having already clipped). If the front end
 * clips before ANY of that digital chain runs, no amount of correct
 * downstream gain math can undo it - the fix has to happen at the
 * PGA, upstream of the ADC, which is what this does automatically
 * instead of requiring a manual PGA tweak every time a strong station
 * shows up.
 *
 * s_pga_gain_db_x2 above KEEPS its existing meaning unchanged: it's
 * the user's manual setting via the encoder/PGA menu tile - now
 * treated as a CEILING this auto-AGC never exceeds, not the literal
 * applied gain anymore. The actual applied gain is always
 * (s_pga_gain_db_x2 - s_rf_agc_backoff_x2), computed and pushed to
 * the codec by rf_agc_apply_pga() - the ONLY place that's allowed to
 * call aic3204_set_pga_gain_db() now (see that function's other two
 * former call sites, both switched over to it below).
 *
 * s_rf_agc_enabled is a genuine master on/off switch, independent of
 * the backoff amount - same "toggle separate from the value" shape as
 * s_nr_on/nr_ss_get_enabled(), per the project owner ("como el botón
 * NR"). Defaults OFF: this changes what gets written to the codec
 * autonomously, based on a heuristic (rf_clip_scan()'s threshold/
 * count in demod_am.c) - opt-in like every other automatic-behavior
 * feature in this codebase (NR, NB historically), not a surprise for
 * someone who hasn't asked for it. While off, rf_agc_apply_pga()
 * still runs (from the two "settings changed" call sites) but always
 * computes effective gain = ceiling - 0 = ceiling, i.e. plain manual
 * PGA exactly as before this feature existed.
 *
 * Backoff/recovery ballistics mirror the digital AGC's own philosophy
 * (fast to protect against clipping, slow to back off from that
 * protection) but on a MUCH coarser timescale, because unlike the
 * digital AGC's per-sample math this drives a bit-banged I2C
 * transaction - RF_AGC_ATTACK_COOLDOWN_MS keeps repeated clip
 * detections from spamming the I2C bus faster than the codec/bus can
 * sanely keep up with, and RF_AGC_RELEASE_COOLDOWN_MS is deliberately
 * many seconds (not milliseconds) so recovery only happens once the
 * signal has ACTUALLY dropped for a while, not during the natural
 * peaks/troughs of a single strong signal's own modulation - a fast
 * release here would just pump the gain up and down audibly in sync
 * with the strong station's own audio envelope, the same "release too
 * fast" pumping problem the digital AGC's profile choices already
 * exist to avoid, just one level up the chain.
 *
 * Rin escalation - added same day, per the datasheet's "Analog PGA
 * versus Input Configuration" table (2.3.2.1): PGA backoff alone tops
 * out at RF_AGC_BACKOFF_MAX_X2 (the PGA register's own 0dB floor,
 * relative to whatever Rin is active). If a signal is STILL clipping
 * once backoff is maxed, there's no more PGA-register room - the next
 * escalation step instead switches aic3204_set_input_impedance() up
 * one level (10k->20k->40k), which shifts the WHOLE gain range down
 * another 6dB, and simultaneously gives back RF_AGC_RIN_STEP_X2 of
 * PGA backoff (since the Rin step itself just provided that same 6dB
 * of attenuation) so the transition is a smooth net 6dB step down,
 * not an abrupt 12dB jump, and so there's PGA-register headroom again
 * to keep fine-tuning within the new range. De-escalation mirrors
 * this in reverse once backoff would go negative at the current Rin
 * level. See rf_agc_escalate_rin()/rf_agc_deescalate_rin() and
 * aic3204_set_input_impedance()'s own comment for the
 * *** IMPORTANT UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION *** about the 20k/40k register

 * --- SNR readout, added 01/09/2026 ------------------------------------
 *
 * Drawn in the gap between the S-meter (ends at SMETER_Y+SMETER_SEG_H)
 * and the status badges (start at BADGE_Y0 = RCOL_Y+60) - plenty of
 * clearance for one scale-1 (7px) text line.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY LABELED "dB", NOT "dBm" - same reasoning as the
 * S-meter's own comment just above: without a calibrated antenna/
 * frontend gain figure, there's no real zero-dBm reference to measure
 * against, so a "dBm" label would be an invented number, same as an
 * invented S-unit would be. An SNR figure sidesteps that problem in a
 * way a standalone level reading can't: it's the DIFFERENCE of two
 * readings taken from the exact same uncalibrated dB-relative scale
 * (sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick()'s own s_db_frame[], already computed
 * every frame for the panadapter/waterfall - no new signal chain
 * added), so whatever fixed calibration offset that scale is missing
 * cancels out in the subtraction. The RESULT is a genuinely meaningful
 * dB figure even though neither of the two numbers that produced it
 * would be, on its own.
 *
 * Signal estimate: the peak bin within SNR_SIGNAL_HALF_WIN bins either
 * side of center (FFT_BINS_IQ/2 - the VFO/tuned point, fftshift order,
 * same convention spectrum_draw()'s center_mark uses).
 * Noise estimate: the plain mean (not median - cheap, no sort needed,
 * and this project's existing dB-domain approximations already accept
 * this kind of looseness elsewhere, e.g. smeter_log2_approx()) of
 * every bin OUTSIDE SNR_GUARD_HALF_WIN bins of center - wide enough to
 * exclude the signal's own filter skirts from polluting the noise
 * floor estimate, at the cost of also excluding some genuinely-quiet
 * spectrum right next to a wide signal (WFM especially - acceptable,
 * given plenty of bins remain either way at FFT_BINS_IQ=256).
 * Both window sizes are bin counts, not Hz - since Hz/bin varies with
 * mode/zoom, the true "channel width in bins" this should track also
 * varies; fixed windows are a first-pass approximation only, same
 * spirit as the S-meter's own un-calibrated honesty above.
 *
 * Like the rest of this status column, this only gets fresh data while
 * the settings menu is closed - s_db_frame itself stops updating while
 * the menu covers the spectrum panel (see sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick()'s
 * own "!s_menu_open" comment) - so unlike the S-meter (driven by
 * demod_am_get_signal_peak(), independent of s_db_frame), this reading
 * visibly freezes while the menu is open rather than going stale
 * silently. Acceptable: there's no fresher spectrum data being
 * computed during that window anyway.

 *               nr_ss.h). Whether it's actually DOING anything right
 *               now also depends on demod mode (AM/USB/LSB only, see
 *               demod_am.c's NR INTEGRATION comment) - this badge
 *               only reflects the on/off switch, not that mode check.
 *               SPT lights up whenever the spectrum's spatial line
 *               smoothing is active (passes > 0) - see
 *               s_spec_smooth_passes' comment; it used to be the NB
 *               (noise blanker) badge, which never drove any real DSP.
 *   AGC       - lit: the demod AGC loop really is always active (even
 *               in MANUAL profile - i.e. the user-facing "AGC off" -
 *               the loop still runs, it just skips the peak-tracking
 *               math and outputs fixed unity gain - see
 *               agc_profile_t's MANUAL note in demod_am.h). This
 *               badge reflects the loop running, not whether it's
 *               actively adjusting gain right now.
 *   [profile] - s_btn_agc_profile, a REAL touchable button (not a
 *               plain badge_draw() call) showing OFF/SLW/MED/FST -
 *               tap it to cycle (MANUAL included again as of

 *               31/07/2026, per the project owner: this slot gets
 *               more use as an interactive control than BW did as a
 *               static readout.
 *   BW        - now a REAL touchable button too (s_btn_audio_bw, added
 *               02/08/2026, same "not a plain badge_draw() call"
 *               treatment as [profile] above): in AM/USB/LSB it shows
 *               the active audio-filter width and tapping it cycles
 *               4K0 -> 2K3 -> 1K8 -> 4K0 (see audio_bw_cycle() and
 *               demod_am_set_audio_bw()'s comment in demod_am.h). In
 *               NFM/WFM it goes back to being purely informative
 *               (channel-filter -3dB width, "6K3"/"96K") and tapping
 *               it does nothing - those modes have their own fixed
 *               filters, unrelated to this selector, see
 *               audio_bw_button_callback()'s comment.
 *   OVR       - RF-level auto-AGC overload indicator (added
 *               07/08/2026), reusing this exact slot - was PRE
 *               (preamp: no such hardware control was ever identified
 *               on this board, shown dark as a placeholder). Lit RED
 *               whenever s_rf_agc_backoff_x2 > 0, i.e. the RF-AGC
 *               (main.c's rf_agc_poll()/s_rf_agc_enabled) is actively
 *               holding the PGA below the user's manual ceiling right
 *               now because it detected front-end clipping - see that
 *               feature's own declaration comment. Deliberately a
 *               BADGE, not the RFAGC grid tile's own label (which
 *               only shows plain ON/OFF now) - a badge lives in the

 *               rf_agc_poll() can safely redraw it from the
 *               background at any time, no matter what's showing in
 *               the menu. The grid tile used to show the live backoff
 *               amount directly on itself; that redraw fired from the
 *               same background poll and could land while some OTHER
 *               MENU_AREA sub-screen (e.g. the PGA detail view) was
 *               on screen, painting stale tile graphics over live
 *               content - exactly the corruption class
 *               menu_tile_bw_callback()'s own guard comment already
 *               warned about, just triggered from a background timer
 *               instead of a one-off user action. ATT (attenuator,
 *               same "no real placeholder" story as the old PRE) was
 *               dropped from this grid earlier to make room for BW's
 *               move - if a real attenuator control ever gets added,
 *               it'll need a new home rather than reclaiming this

 * --- Settings menu screen: tile geometry + callbacks --------------------
 *
 * CONFINED to the spectrum+waterfall area (MENU_AREA_*) rather than
 * the whole 800x480 screen - changed 31/07/2026 per the project
 * owner: the top bar (frequency/mode/time/battery) and the right
 * column (S-meter/badges) and the bottom button bar all stay live and
 * visible while the menu is open, only the graph itself gets replaced
 * by the tile grid. See s_menu_screen's declaration comment for how
 * touch routing and the still-running S-meter/time updates work with
 * two screens effectively active in different SCREEN REGIONS at once.
 *
 * Grid: 4 columns x 3 rows, 159x108px tiles, 8px gaps, inside
 * MENU_AREA (676x358, starting at (0,SPEC_Y)).
 *
 * REDESIGNED 03/08/2026, per the project owner, from one flat 4x3
 * grid of 12 interchangeable tiles into a PAGED layout:
 *
 *   - Column 0 (all 3 rows): page NAVIGATION, always present and
 *     never changing shape - see the PAGINATION note below for what
 *     lives in it now.
 *   - Columns 1-3 (all 3 rows = 9 slots): the selected page's
 *     OPTIONS, laid out row-major (slot 0 = row0/col1, slot 1 =
 *     row0/col2, ..., slot 7 = row2/col2). Slot 8 (row2/col3,
 *     bottom-right) is ALWAYS EXIT, regardless of which page is
 *     selected - it closes the whole menu (menu_screen_close()), same
 *     as the long-press-the-knob gesture does from anywhere (see
 *     tune_encoder_poll()'s comment). A page that doesn't fill all 8
 *     option slots just leaves the rest empty (black).
 *
 * PAGINATION, added 09/08/2026, per the project owner: column 0 was
 * originally a fixed 3-tile PAGE SELECTOR, one tile per row, one page
 * per tile (RADIO/UI/HW - fit exactly because there were exactly 3
 * pages). That doesn't scale - MENU_AREA_H only has room for 3 tile
 * rows total (see the height-budget comment on FREQ_KEYPAD's geometry
 * just below for how tight that already is), so a 4th page (DIG, see
 * below) has nowhere to add a 4th row. Column 0 is now a PAGER
 * instead, reusing the exact same 3 slots regardless of how many
 * pages exist:
 *   - Row 0: "PREV" - steps s_menu_page back one, wrapping from page 0
 *     to the last page.
 *   - Row 1: the CURRENT page's name (k_menu_page_names[]), solid
 *     ORANGE-on-BLACK same as the old "selected" look - purely
 *     informational (enabled=0, see ui_screen_add_button()'s comment
 *     in ui.c for what that does: still painted, never reacts to
 *     touch) since it can't mean "switch to this page", it already IS
 *     this page.
 *   - Row 2: "NEXT" - steps s_menu_page forward one, wrapping from the
 *     last page back to 0.
 * Both PREV/NEXT share menu_page_step_callback() (direction via
 * user_data, same (void*)(uintptr_t) pattern the old per-page
 * callback used), styled ORANGE-outlined (BLACK-on-BLACK fill, ORANGE
 * text/border) same as the old unselected page tiles - visually
 * distinct from the CYAN/DARKGRAY/YELLOW palette the option tiles use,
 * so "this changes pages" still reads differently from "this is a
 * page's option" at a glance. Adding a 5th, 6th, ... page later is
 * just another menu_page_t enum value + k_menu_page_names[] entry + a
 * switch case in menu_grid_show() below - column 0 itself never needs
 * to change again.
 *
 * Per-page option assignment (all pre-existing tiles, just
 * relocated - no settings were dropped):
 *   RADIO (slots 0-7): AGC, SQL (squelch), VOL, BW, PGA, NR (Spectral
 *                       Subtraction strength, AM/USB/LSB only), RFAGC
 *                       (RF-level auto-AGC toggle, slot 6, added
 *                       07/08/2026), ATT (manual codec input
 *                       attenuator, slot 7, added 01/09/2026 - see
 *                       menu_tile_att_callback()'s comment).
 *   UI    (slots 0-5): BL (backlight), SCALE, SPT, SMH (smooth),
 *                       SPC (spectrum trace style, HEATMAP<->LINE),
 *                       ZOOM.
 *   HW    (slots 0-1, 4): SPK - speaker PA enable/mute (PB7, see
 *                       speaker_pa_set_enabled()'s comment - pin/
 *                       polarity UNCONFIRMED as of 03/08/2026). IFBW -

 *                       Slots 5-7 reserved for future hardware
 *                       settings.
 *   DIG   (slots 0-2), added 09/08/2026: digital-mode (currently just
 *                       RTTY) parameters that no longer fit on RADIO
 *                       once it hit 8/8 - see the SHIFT tile's
 *                       declaration comment for why it moved here
 *                       rather than staying put. SHIFT (mark/space
 *                       separation), BAUD (bit rate), INV (station
 *                       NORMAL/REVERSE convention, independent of the
 *                       USB/LSB sideband mirror RTTY-L/RTTY-U already
 *                       handle - see rtty_set_station_inverted()'s
 *                       comment in rtty.h for the DDK9 field finding
 *                       that prompted this). Slots 3-7 reserved for
 *                       future digital modes (PSK31 and similar).
 *
 * Tile behavior is unchanged from before the redesign, just
 * regrouped by page:
 *   - AGC, SPT, SPC, BW, ZOOM, and BAUD CYCLE/TOGGLE DIRECTLY on tap
 *     (same as their existing bottom-bar-button/badge equivalents
 *     where they have one) and stay on this screen - you can tap
 *     several of these in a row. INV is the same shape as RFAGC/SPK:
 *     a plain two-state toggle, not a multi-way cycle.
 *   - SQL/BL/SCALE/VOL/SMH/PGA/SHIFT instead open a DETAIL view
 *     (menu_detail_show()) for that target - see its own comment.
 *
 * menu_grid_show() itself always redraws the WHOLE MENU_AREA (page
 * column + options + EXIT) in one pass, including on a page switch -
 * simplest correct thing (no separate "clear just the options area"
 * path to keep in sync), and cheap enough for a menu tap.

 * --- Spectrum/waterfall ZOOM --------------------------------------------
 *
 * Added 31/07/2026, per the project owner - NOT a codec/sample-rate
 * change (see the earlier discussion on why that's both risky, with
 * no reference capture to replay, and not actually what was needed).
 * This is a purely DIGITAL zoom: the codec/ADC/I2S keep running at
 * 48kHz exactly as always, untouched (was 192kHz before 04/08/2026 -
 * see sdr_rx.h's SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES comment for THAT separate,
 * actual sample-rate change - this zoom mechanism itself needed no
 * code changes at all for it, being generic decimate-by-2 regardless
 * of what Fs it's fed; only the absolute Hz spans below moved).
 *
 * How it works: cascade 1-3 stages of a generic decimate-by-2 FIR
 * (ZOOM_DECIM2_COEFFS, see its own comment) on a COPY of the raw I/Q,
 * re-centered on the actual tuned frequency first (same delay-free
 * sign-flip rotation demod_am.c's low-IF down-mix uses, applied here
 * only when demod_am_get_if_offset_active() is set - see
 * zoom_process_block()). Enough decimated samples accumulate across
 * however many raw 96kHz blocks it takes to fill one FFT_SIZE window,
 * then that window feeds the SAME fft_compute_db_iq() the unzoomed
 * view already uses - no change to the FFT itself, just what feeds it.
 *
 *   SPEC_ZOOM_1X - unchanged existing behavior: FFT runs directly on
 *                  the raw 96kHz block, every block, +/-48kHz span.
 *                  ZERO extra cost - the whole zoom pipeline below is
 *                  skipped entirely at this setting.
 *   SPEC_ZOOM_2X - one decimate-by-2 stage, +/-12kHz span. Needs 2 raw
 *                  blocks (~5.3ms) per FFT window.
 *   SPEC_ZOOM_4X - two cascaded stages, +/-6kHz span, 4 raw blocks
 *                  (~10.7ms) per window.
 *   SPEC_ZOOM_8X - three cascaded stages, +/-3kHz span, 8 raw blocks
 *                  (~21.3ms) per window.
 *
 * REFRESH RATE TRADEOFF, inherent to any zoom-FFT (not a bug to fix):
 * higher zoom means each window takes longer to fill, so the spectrum/
 * waterfall update less often - see sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick()'s
 * comment for exactly how that's handled (skip drawing, don't block,
 * when a window isn't ready yet).

 * to the right of center (see sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick()'s comment
 * and the red marker it draws there). Under ZOOM, on the other hand,
 * zoom_process_block() re-centers on s_tune_hz BEFORE decimating, so
 * the panel center genuinely IS s_tune_hz there. panel_center_hz
 * below picks the right one of those two, the EXACT same condition
 * center_mark_offset_px uses - so this scale, the red center marker,
 * and the demodulated-bandwidth tint all agree on which frequency
 * sits at which pixel. Getting this wrong would silently mislabel
 * every non-WFM reading by 48kHz (the whole 1X span) at 1X zoom - worth the extra
 * conditional to avoid.
 *
 * The two edges are the exact +/-half_span_hz boundary of whatever
 * the CURRENT zoom shows (96/48/24/12kHz - see the switch below), so
 * they track ZOOM automatically, same as the marker/tint do.
 * panel_center_hz +/- half_span_hz can, in principle, run outside
 * TUNE_MIN_HZ/MAX_HZ (e.g. tuned near the 100kHz floor, minus 96kHz
 * of span) - int64_t math + a floor-at-0 clamp keeps that from
 * wrapping a uint32_t negative into a huge bogus frequency; showing
 * an edge label below the tunable floor is harmless (there's no
 * corresponding "real" edge case to get wrong here, it's just a
 * label), unlike clamping the LO itself would be.
 *
 * MUST be redrawn on every actual frequency change, not just at
 * init/menu-close - "esta escala tiene que variar con la frecuencia".
 * Call sites: radio_screen_draw() (initial paint), menu_screen_close()
 * (also covers band-preset/mode changes applied from the menu, which
 * both close it on their way out - see menu_band_preset_callback()'s
 * and menu_mode_preset_callback()'s comments), tune_encoder_poll()'s
 * TUNE branch (knob retune) and spec_drag_tune_apply() (touch drag-
 * to-tune) - the two places s_tune_hz changes WITHOUT going through
 * the menu. Cheap enough (a handful of small draws, same cost class
 * as freq_display_draw() it's always paired with) to just redraw on
 * every change rather than diffing against the last-drawn value.

 * (band presets, the MODE picker) call this instead of demod_am_set_
 * mode() directly - a mode change from either one can cross the WFM
 * boundary just as easily as the other.
 *
 * SEQUENCE (order matters throughout - see aic3204_rate_switch_reset()'s
 * comment in aic3204.c for the full story of why this exact order was
 * needed, found via real hardware testing across several earlier
 * attempts that each glitched a different way):
 *   1. Stop BOTH DMA channels (capture + TX stream) - reprogramming
 *      codec clock dividers while the I2S bus is actively clocking
 *      risks exactly the bus-contention/RXORERR history this project
 *      already fought once (see gd32_i2s.h's architecture comment).
 *   2. Reset the codec (aic3204_rate_switch_reset(), a real hardware
 *      nRESET pulse) - the codec falls completely silent, no BCLK/WS
 *      at all, until step 4 below.
 *   3. Resize both DMA channels' transfer counts for the NEW rate and
 *      swap which function receives each captured block
 *      (demod_am_process_raw <-> demod_wfm_process_raw) - these have
 *      entirely separate buffers/state (see demod_wfm_process_raw()'s
 *      comment on the "ruta separada" decision), so this swap alone
 *      is what actually routes audio through the right pipeline.
 *   4. Re-arm both DMA channels (sdr_rx_start()/gd32_i2s_stream_
 *      start()) - the GD32's own I2S peripherals resync here too,
 *      and critically, this happens WHILE the codec is STILL SILENT
 *      from step 2 - the GD32 side is listening and ready before the
 *      codec ever produces a single real clock edge, matching how
 *      cold boot naturally orders things. Getting this ordering
 *      backwards (codec clocking again before the GD32 side resyncs)
 *      is what caused a persistent SPI_STAT_FERR that neither a full
 *      register reset NOR a genuine hardware reset alone could fix -
 *      see aic3204_rate_switch_reset()'s comment for that whole story.
 *   5. NOW reconfigure the codec's registers for the new rate
 *      (aic3204_configure_rate()) - BCLK/WS start coming back partway
 *      through this call, straight into a GD32 side that's already
 *      armed and listening from the first real edge.
 *   6. Power the codec's ADC/DAC back UP
 *      (aic3204_set_rate_power_up()) - only NOW does real audio data
 *      start flowing, straight into an already-armed DMA path. Doing
 *      this any earlier left a window where real samples arrived with
 *      nothing draining them - a continuous receive overrun that read
 *      as "sounds like NFM"/bandwidth-limited, not a DSP bug, and
 *      never recovered on its own even after the DMA was eventually
 *      armed.
 *
 * A brief audio/spectrum dropout during this sequence is EXPECTED,
 * not a bug - see the project owner's own acknowledgment of this
 * tradeoff when the dual-rate approach was first discussed.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP as of 05/08/2026: the panadapter's own FFT/spectrum
 * pipeline (fft.c, main.c's spectrum buffers) is NOT YET resized for
 * WFM's 512-sample blocks by this function - it stays fixed at
 * FFT_SIZE=128 regardless of which rate is active. The AUDIO path
 * above is fully correct either way; the SPECTRUM DISPLAY while in
 * WFM is the remaining piece, tracked separately, not blocking this
 * audio-path change from being useful on its own.

 * exactly like real signal (small, smoothly-varying values, matching

 * sample, it's wild alternating near-full-scale swings that don't
 * look like RF content at all (e.g. one pair +21516/+21502 followed
 * two samples later by an almost exact negation, -21503/-20482) -
 * the classic signature of an I2S slave locking onto the WS (word
 * select / frame sync) line at the WRONG bit-phase when the
 * peripheral is disabled and re-enabled. Which phase it lands on
 * depends on the exact clock edge at the moment of re-enable, so it's
 * genuinely a coin-flip per switch - explaining why no amount of
 * settle-muting or AGC tuning ever fixed the reported "ruido/pitido
 * fuerte, sin voz reconocible", since real numbers were being
 * computed from corrupted samples the whole session through, not
 * just for the first few blocks.
 *
 * Fix: after arming and powering up, capture one real block and check

 * re-enable/rearm sequence and check again, up to
 * RX_LOCK_MAX_ATTEMPTS times. This can't fix WHICH phase the hardware

 * *** 05/08/2026, REWRITTEN - "full reinit instead of live resync" ***
 *
 * Every earlier version of this function tried to keep the I2S
 * peripherals' and codec's EXISTING configuration and nudge them back
 * into sync for the new rate - a disable/re-enable of I2SEN, a partial
 * codec register rewrite, then (after that was proven insufficient) a
 * full codec register replay via a genuine nRESET - while the GD32
 * side only ever got the lighter disable/re-enable treatment. Real
 * hardware logs kept finding the same result regardless of exactly
 * which combination was tried: FERR fires after a live switch and
 * NEVER clears again, while running a rate from a genuine COLD BOOT
 * (gd32_i2s_init_slave()+aic3204_phase2_init(), once, before the main
 * loop starts) is rock solid, FERR always 0, indefinitely - confirmed
 * directly by testing a build that boots straight into 192kHz and
 * never switches at all: perfect audio, no FERR, for the entire
 * session.
 *
 * That gap (cold boot always clean, ANY live switch never fully
 * clean) means the difference isn't which registers get rewritten -
 * it's that a live switch was never actually doing the SAME thing cold
 * boot does. This version fixes that literally: every switch that
 * crosses the 96kHz/192kHz boundary now runs gd32_i2s_init_slave(rate)
 * (gd32_i2s.c) - a FULL spi_i2s_deinit()/PLLI2S reconfigure/i2s_init()/
 * GPIO-AF replay, not just re-enabling what was already configured -
 * immediately followed by the exact same codec bring-up cold boot
 * uses (aic3204_rate_switch_reset() + aic3204_configure_rate() +
 * aic3204_start_bclk_wclk() + aic3204_set_rate_power_up()) and the
 * exact same DMA bring-up (sdr_rx_bringup()/gd32_i2s_stream_arm(),
 * which sdr_rx_init()/gd32_i2s_dma_start_stream() now also call under
 * the hood for cold boot, so there is only ONE bring-up path left,
 * not a separate "lighter" one for live switches to drift out of sync
 * with).

 * see ms5351.h's history comment).
 *
 * Preconditions enforced here rather than just documented, since a
 * bogus correction silently applied would be worse than no
 * correction at all:
 *   - Must be in SAM mode (sam_current_ppm_error() is meaningless
 *     otherwise - the PLL isn't even running).
 *   - |ppm| must be under CAL_PPM_SANITY_LIMIT - a PLL that hasn't
 *     locked yet (just switched into SAM, or not actually tuned to a
 *     carrier) reads garbage/noise here, not a real crystal error;
 *     50ppm is already enormous for any crystal, genuine values from
 *     the 21/08/2026 measurements were ~3ppm - this is a "reject
 *     obvious garbage" gate, not a tight tolerance.
 * Both rejections flash the tile label with a short reason (see
 * menu_tile_cal_ppm_refresh()) instead of silently doing nothing, so
 * a tap that didn't work doesn't look identical to one that did.
 *
 * On success: computes the corrected crystal frequency from the
 * CURRENTLY assumed one (ms5351_get_xtal_hz(), not the compiled-in
 * default) so repeated calibration runs compose correctly instead of
 * each one overwriting the last from the same 26MHz nominal baseline;
 * applies it (ms5351_set_xtal_hz()); forces an immediate retune at
 * the current VFO frequency so the correction takes effect without
 * requiring the user to nudge the encoder first; and saves CONFIG.CSV
 * right away (settings_save_now(), not the debounced path - same
 * "deliberate, infrequent action" reasoning as touch_calib_done_callback()
 * just above).

 *
 * No decimal point key - deliberately. The three accept buttons
 * (Hz/kHz/MHz) already cover fractional MHz entry without needing a
 * float parser on a bare-metal target: typing "146520" then tapping
 * kHz gives 146,520,000 Hz (146.520MHz) exactly as if you'd typed
 * "146.520" and tapped MHz. Hz stays available for the rare case of
 * wanting the exact integer Hz value directly (e.g. from a frequency

 * 76px by reclaiming part of the scope's own trace height too - see
 * RTTY_TEXT_PANEL_H/RTTY_SCOPE_TRACE_H's comment just below for the
 * exact split. Net effect: a real multi-line RTTY_TEXT_ROWS x
 * RTTY_TEXT_COLS character grid instead of one ticker line, at the
 * cost of a shorter (but still plenty resolving, see rtty_scope_draw()'s
 * own comment on why the FFT itself is unaffected) tuning-scope trace.
 *
 * Genuinely LINE-ORIENTED now, not a byte ring buffer: rtty_text_push()
 * tracks a cursor (row, col) into a fixed character grid.
 *   - Printable characters just get placed at the cursor and advance
 *     it; hitting RTTY_TEXT_COLS without an explicit CR/LF hard-wraps
 *     to a new row (character wrap, not word wrap - this decoder has
 *     no idea where a word boundary will fall until a character is
 *     already committed to the grid, so word-wrap would need a whole
 *     extra layer of lookahead/reflow for little practical benefit at
 *     ~50 baud).
 *   - CR and LF both start a new row - the actual fix for "line
 *     endings aren't interpreted" - but a RUN of consecutive CR/LF
 *     characters (real stations commonly send CR CR LF, or CR LF, at
 *     end of line - the double CR gives an electromechanical
 *     teleprinter's print head time to return) collapses to exactly
 *     ONE line break via s_rtty_text_last_was_eol, so that convention
 *     doesn't leave a trail of blank rows eating into the limited
 *     scrollback.
 *   - Once RTTY_TEXT_ROWS fills, the grid scrolls up by one row (the
 *     oldest line dropped) instead of wrapping/overwriting - a real
 *     scrollback feel instead of the old ticker's single-line slide.

 * resolution problem that motivated a dedicated 512-point real FFT
 * (23.4Hz/bin @ 12kHz vs the RF spectrum's fixed 256-point/46.9Hz-bin
 * @ its own 8X zoom - insufficient to separate a 170Hz RTTY shift,
 * confirmed by hand before this was built) is completely unrelated to
 * which function paints the pixels - fft.c's FFT_SIZE is a
 * compile-time constant shared by the real-time RF spectrum/waterfall
 * path, not something this panel can safely resize without touching
 * that shared, performance-critical engine. Shrinking RTTY_SCOPE_
 * TRACE_H (see this block's top comment) only affects the trace's
 * on-screen PIXEL HEIGHT (amplitude axis) - it has no bearing on this
 * frequency-axis resolution at all.
 *
 * Linear magnitude -> dB conversion: rtty_scope_get_frame() returns
 * power normalized to the frame's own peak (0..1, see its comment) -
 * converted here to dB relative to that peak (0dB at the peak,
 * clamped to a DB_FLOOR below), matching the normal spectrum's own
 * dB-based convention and giving spectrum_draw()'s log-scaled
 * rendering something meaningful to compress - a raw linear 0..1
 * plot would look overly spiky (peak dominant, everything else
 * nearly invisible) compared to how any of HEATMAP/LINE/OUTLINE
 * actually expect to be fed. Uses the same IEEE754 bit-trick log2
 * approximation as the S-meter (smeter_log2_approx()) instead of
 * libm's log10f, for the same reason: this project links without
 * syscall stubs, and log10f drags in __errno.
 *
 * Two vertical marker lines at the LIVE rtty_get_mark_hz()/
 * rtty_get_space_hz() (cyan/orange) - not the config.h defaults
 * directly, since those are now just the STARTING point (see
 * rtty_set_mark_space_hz()'s comment: the encoder nudges these live
 * while the scope is showing). Drawn AFTER spectrum_draw() every
 * frame, unconditionally - no more separate "erase the old line
 * position" bookkeeping needed (that used to matter when this used a
 * diff-based bar renderer that only touched CHANGED columns;
 * spectrum_draw() repaints every column every call, so any previous
 * line position gets overwritten as a side effect automatically).
 *
 * Text panel drawn LAST, via rtty_text_panel_draw() - separated out
 * (10/08/2026) from this function's own body since it now has its own
 * dirty-flag gating (see s_rtty_text_dirty's comment) rather than the

 * Drag-to-tune on the spectrum panel - added 01/08/2026 per the
 * project owner: dragging a finger across the spectrum RIGHT lowers
 * the tuned frequency, LEFT raises it - the classic "pan the content"
 * feel (like dragging a map or photo: dragging right reveals what was
 * further left, i.e. LOWER frequency on this panadapter, since
 * frequency increases left-to-right - see spec_span_labels_draw()'s
 * tick ruler).
 *
 * QUANTIZED to whole SPEC_DRAG_HZ_STEP jumps (1kHz) rather than
 * applied as continuous fractional Hz - added same day, per the
 * project owner: raw pixel-proportional Hz produced odd non-round
 * frequencies and, on this still-uncalibrated resistive touch panel
 * (see demo_touch_poll()'s CALIBRATION NOTE), tiny single-pixel
 * jitter was enough to wobble the tuned frequency by a few Hz with no
 * visible finger movement. *hz_accum carries the sub-step remainder
 * between calls - same carry technique encoder_take_delta() already
 * uses for quarter-steps, so a slow drag that hasn't crossed a full
 * 1kHz yet isn't lost, just accumulated for next time. Reset by the
 * caller (demo_touch_poll()) at the START of each new drag gesture -
 * see its comment - so leftover remainder from a previous unrelated
 * drag never bleeds into this one.
 *
 * Hz-per-pixel (before quantizing) still comes from the current
 * zoom's span (see spec_span_labels_draw()'s switch for where these
 * same span numbers come from) divided across SPEC_TRACE_W, so how
 * much finger travel one 1kHz step takes still scales with zoom -
 * finer control zoomed in, coarser zoomed out - only the OUTPUT is
 * now snapped to round steps, not the sensitivity.
 *
 * Called once per touch SAMPLE while dragging (see demo_touch_poll()),
 * not once per gesture - dx_px is the delta since the LAST sample, not
 * since the press started, so the trace/frequency updates live as the
 * finger moves rather than jumping once on release.

 * *** CRITICAL FIX 05/08/2026 - was sized at plain SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES
 * (128), but sdr_rx_poll_block_iq() below (line ~4169) writes
 * sdr_rx_get_block_samples() samples - which is
 * SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES_WFM (512) while WFM is active. That was a
 * silent ~768-byte WRITE overrun past the end of EACH of these two
 * arrays on every single spectrum poll while in WFM - textbook memory
 * corruption of whatever static variables happen to sit next in the
 * linker layout, which is almost certainly what the project owner
 * saw as "el espectro se ralentiza, el volumen se sube solo, se
 * activan otros menus solos, y al volver a AM se cuelga" - all
 * classic symptoms of a buffer overrun clobbering unrelated state
 * (gain variables, UI state, whatever else the linker happened to
 * place right after these two arrays), not four separate bugs.
 *
 * Sized at SDR_RX_BLOCK_SAMPLES_MAX now so it can never overflow
 * regardless of which rate is active - same fix pattern as
 * s_stream_buf/s_raw_buf already got today for the exact same class
 * of bug (see gd32_i2s.c's STREAM_FRAMES_PER_HALF comment and
 * sdr_rx.c's own header comment).
 *
 * NOTE - this fixes the CRASH/CORRUPTION, not yet the DISPLAY: the
 * FFT/spectrum pipeline below this point still processes a fixed
 * FFT_SIZE (256) samples regardless of how many sdr_rx actually
 * delivered, so the panadapter in WFM will show only the FIRST 256 of
 * the 512 samples per block (a real picture, just not WFM's full
 * span) until that's resized too - see this project's WFM migration
 * notes for that remaining, separately-tracked piece. Nothing below
 * reads past what it currently reads, so this is now safe, just
 * incomplete for WFM specifically.

 * filter is correct whether it's decimating 192kHz->96kHz (stage 1),
 * 96kHz->48kHz (stage 2), or 48kHz->24kHz (stage 3). Designed offline
 * via scipy.signal.firwin (Hamming window, same general FIR-lowpass
 * approach as demod_am.c's DECIM_COEFFS, just far shorter - a single
 * x2 stage doesn't need anywhere near that much stopband rejection,
 * especially since ZOOM_8X cascades three of these for a combined
 * ~84dB at the critical alias-fold point, verified numerically:
 *
 *   0.10-0.30 x Nyquist: essentially flat (+/-0.01dB) - the passband
 *   0.42 x Nyquist:      -6.00dB (roughly the -6dB corner)
 *   0.50 x Nyquist:      -27.97dB (the post-decimation Nyquist - the
 *                         worst-case fold-back point for aliasing)
 *   0.55-1.0 x Nyquist:  -54 to -62dB (deep stopband)
 *
 * A single stage's -28dB at the fold point is on the modest side for
 * a rigorous decimator, but this feeds a VISUAL spectrum display, not
 * a measurement - and cascading stages for higher zoom multiplies
 * that rejection (three stages for ZOOM_8X -> ~84dB), so it only gets

             * (blocks with a big negative mean gave ~10^8-magnitude
             * "correlation" at EVERY shift, changing by only a few %
             * across the whole -3..+3 range - a flat offset artifact,
             * not a lag-dependent peak), and the "best shift" jumped
             * around inconsistently between captures (-2, +1, -3, +1)
             * with no repeating winner - exactly what pure DC/noise
             * would produce, and the opposite of what a real, fixed
             * hardware misalignment should look like (the same shift
             * winning every time). Now removes each window's own mean
             * from I and Q before correlating (a real covariance, not
             * a raw dot product), and only calls a shift "meaningful"
             * if it beats the runner-up by a clear margin (>2x) -
             * otherwise this reports "inconclusive" rather than
             * pointing at a shift that's really just noise dressed up
             * as a number. Needs several REPEATED captures showing the
             * SAME winning shift before trusting it as a real,
             * physical misalignment - one capture proves nothing
             * either way.

/*
 * --- Speaker PA enable/mute (PB7) ---------------------------------------
 *
 * Added 03/08/2026, per the project owner: a software mute for the
 * onboard speaker power amplifier, toggled from the HW-page tile in
 * the settings menu (see MENU_PAGE_HW in menu_grid_show()) - lets you
 * listen on headphones only, without the speaker PA also driving.
 *
 * *** PIN/POLARITY UNCONFIRMED (03/08/2026) ***
 * PB7 was given from memory ("PB7 creo" - not yet checked against a
 * schematic or bench-verified). Per this project's own established
 * debugging principle (see the AIC3204 I2S master/slave bring-up
 * history: never assume a fixed hardware mapping from memory, always
 * confirm against the datasheet/schematic or a live measurement)
 * this should be verified with a multimeter/scope BEFORE relying on
 * it - worst case if it's wrong is simply that the tile does nothing
 * audible (or drives an unrelated/floating pin), not damage, but it's
 * still unconfirmed. SPEAKER_PA_PIN below is the only place to change
 * if PB7 turns out wrong. SPEAKER_PA_ACTIVE_HIGH is the only place to
 * flip if the enable polarity turns out to be active-LOW instead
 * (defaulted here to active-HIGH, the more common convention for a
 * load-switch/amp EN pin - equally UNCONFIRMED).
