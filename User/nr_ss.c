/*
 * Noise reduction by Spectral Subtraction - ported 03/08/2026 from
 * JF3HZB / T. Uebo's ESP32 nr_ss.c/h (uploaded by the project owner:
 * "Created on June 10, 2025") to this project's bare-metal GD32F450
 * pipeline. See nr_ss.h for the module's contract; this comment is
 * about what changed getting here from the original.
 *
 * SCOPE: AM/USB/LSB only, mainly SSB - NOT WFM/NFM, per the project
 * owner. demod_am.c gates the call accordingly; this file has no idea
 * what a "demod mode" even is.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL:
 *
 *   - dsps_fft2r_fc32()/dsps_bit_rev2r_fc32() (ESP-DSP, Xtensa) ->
 *     nr_fft_transform() below: a small self-contained radix-2
 *     complex FFT, same style (local Bhaskara-I sin/cos
 *     approximation, no libm dependency in the per-block hot path) as
 *     this project's own fft.c - see its "reimplemented locally to
 *     keep the two modules decoupled" note; same reasoning applied
 *     here rather than sharing fft.c's engine (which is hardwired to
 *     FFT_SIZE=512 real-input for the panadapter - generalizing it
 *     risked that well-exercised code for a completely different
 *     use, when a fresh ~130-line engine at this module's own fixed
 *     size is simpler and safer). CMSIS-DSP's arm_cfft_f32() would
 *     have been the other option, but it needs the CommonTables
 *     twiddle infrastructure this project has deliberately never
 *     pulled in (see the Makefile's comment by the CMSIS-DSP source
 *     list) - not worth the flash for a 128-point transform this
 *     cheap to hand-roll.
 *
 *   - Nstfft: the original computed this from the ESP32 project's own
 *     SAMPLE_BUFFER_SIZE/DR (not ours - sdr.h was never provided).
 *     Here it's NR_SS_BLOCK_SAMPLES (32, matching demod_am.c's
 *     EXISTING DEC_BLOCK_SAMPLES - the SSB phasing chain's decimated
 *     rate, reused rather than duplicated) * Nframe (4) = 128. A
 *     naive port running at this project's full 192kHz audio rate
 *     instead (matching the "no decimation" note elsewhere in this
 *     codebase) would have needed Nstfft=2048 - 16x the FFT cost, and
 *     inside a hard-realtime ISR with a documented ~2.667ms/block
 *     budget (see demod_am.c's ISR TIMING INSTRUMENTATION comment,
 *     added after a past deadline-overrun hang). Running at the
 *     already-decimated 12kHz rate instead was the project owner's
 *     call, and is why this fits.
 *
 *   - extern V_Rsv (an ESP32-side potentiometer reading, 0-4095) ->
 *     nr_ss_set_strength(), called from a new NR tile in the settings
 *     menu (RADIO page, ENCODER_TARGET_NR - see main.c).
 *
 *   - extern nr_ss_debug -> dropped. This project's debug_print() is
 *     used directly wherever useful instead of a one-shot latched
 *     flag.
 *
 *   - fabs()/pow() (double) -> fabsf()/powf() (float). This project
 *     is float32_t throughout; the originals were double-precision
 *     calls sitting in an otherwise-float pipeline - presumably
 *     harmless on the ESP32's FPU, but not a habit worth carrying
 *     over (and this project links -lm already, as of the WFM
 *     atan2f() addition, so powf() is free to use here without
 *     needing its own local approximation - it only runs once per
 *     nr_ss_set_strength() call, not per-sample, so it wouldn't have
 *     mattered much either way).
 *
 *   - NR_SS_init()/NR_SS() (CamelCase) -> nr_ss_init()/nr_ss_process()
 *     - this project's naming convention (see any other module here).
 *
 *   - The overlap-add reconstruction's final scale factor: the
 *     original's Nframe==4 branch has the "correct" unity-gain
 *     normalization (ATT_Ratio * (1.0f/Nframe)) commented OUT, with a
 *     bare "*= 500" active instead - almost certainly a leftover
 *     empirical scale factor tuned for THAT project's own signal
 *     range at that point in ITS pipeline, not a deliberate part of
 *     the algorithm (the commented-out line is the mathematically
 *     "proper" one - it's what ATT_Ratio's Hann/4x-overlap derivation
 *     is FOR). This port uses that proper normalization
 *     (NR_SS_ATT_RATIO below) instead of guessing at a scale factor
 *     that has no reason to match our signal range. Expect this may
 *     still need an empirical makeup-gain tweak once tried on real
 *     hardware, same as any NR stage's "how strong should this sound"
 *     - the strength control is exactly the knob for that, but if the
 *     OVERALL level (not just the reduction amount) needs a nudge,
 *     this is the constant to revisit.
 *
 * WHAT DIDN'T CHANGE: the actual spectral-subtraction algorithm
 * (Hann window, FFT -> magnitude-domain gain via a fixed threshold ->
 * IFFT, 4-frame 75%-overlap-add) is the same as the original, same
 * constants (the amp/gain formula's 0.96043457f/0.39782422f weights,
 * the Noise_min/max threshold range).
