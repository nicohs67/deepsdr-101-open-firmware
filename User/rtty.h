/*
 * RTTY (radioteletype) decoder - added 08/08/2026, per the project
 * owner. Same "decoupled from the radio pipeline" shape as nr_ss.h:
 * this module knows nothing about demod modes or decimation, it just
 * processes whatever RTTY_BLOCK_SAMPLES-sample float AUDIO block it's
 * handed (READ-ONLY - unlike nr_ss_process(), this doesn't modify the
 * audio, it's a passive listener). demod_am.c owns deciding WHEN to
 * call it (USB/LSB only - RTTY is received as two audio tones inside
 * an SSB passband, there's no meaning to "RTTY in AM/NFM/WFM") and
 * WHERE the audio comes from - see demod_am.c's RTTY INTEGRATION
 * comment, right where s_ssb_dec (the SSB chain's own already-12kHz
 * buffer) gets reused for this, same "don't decimate twice" reasoning
 * already established for USB/LSB's own inline NR path.
 *
 * *** VALIDATED 08/08/2026 *** - a real "PORTAPACK" + alphabet +
 * digits test message decoded cleanly once mark/space were tuned
 * against rtty_scope.c's tuning scope and USB/LSB inversion was
 * handled correctly (see menu_mode_preset_callback()'s RTTY-L/RTTY-U
 * handling). Bit-sync timing and the Baudot table both hold up in
 * practice, not just in theory - CONFIG_RTTY_DIAG_ENABLED in config.h
 * has the verbose per-character raw-bit dump that got this confirmed,
 * left in place (default off) for next time a decode-quality issue
 * needs that level of detail. See rtty.c's top-of-file comment for
 * anything that still might need tuning for a DIFFERENT setup
 * (mark/space frequencies are inherently receiver/convention-specific
 * - see config.h's own warning on those).
