/*
 * RTTY tuning scope - added 08/08/2026, per the project owner: the
 * main RF spectrum, even at its finest zoom (8X, Fs=12kHz, 256 IQ
 * bins -> 46.9Hz/bin), only gives ~3.6 bins of separation for a
 * standard 170Hz-shift RTTY signal - with the Hann window already in
 * fft.c (wider main lobe than a rectangular window, by design, to
 * control leakage), two comparable-amplitude tones that close
 * together visually merge into one blob rather than showing as two
 * distinct peaks. Confirmed against the project owner's own testing:
 * couldn't distinguish the two tones at 8X with a real 170Hz-shift
 * signal, could estimate ~850Hz would have been needed to see them
 * clearly with the RF spectrum as it stands.
 *
 * This is a SEPARATE, dedicated FFT - not a further RF zoom level -
 * on the AUDIO domain instead of RF: it reads s_ssb_dec, the exact
 * same already-12kHz SSB audio buffer rtty.c's decoder itself reads
 * (see demod_am.c's RTTY INTEGRATION comment) - so tuning against
 * this shows EXACTLY what the decoder sees, with no IF-offset or
 * RF-zoom-decimation approximation in between. At 512 points @
 * 12kHz = 23.4Hz/bin, a 170Hz shift is ~7.3 bins apart - comfortably
 * resolvable. Real input (not I/Q), so no need to distinguish +f
 * from -f the way the RF spectrum does - audio only has positive
 * frequencies 0..6kHz (Nyquist) to worry about.
 *
 * Own self-contained radix-2 FFT (same algorithm/style as fft.c,
 * deliberately NOT shared code - see fft.c's own local sin/cos/log2
 * approximations comment for why modules in this project stay
 * decoupled rather than share a common DSP utility file): different
 * size (512 vs fft.c's fixed 256), different input type (float audio
 * samples vs fft.c's int16 ADC samples), different consumer (a
 * one-off tuning aid, not the real-time waterfall) - similar enough
 * to look like duplication, different enough that sharing would mean
 * either bloating fft.c with a second size/input-type path or making
 * the real-time spectrum's hot code depend on this debug tool's
 * needs. Kept separate on purpose.
 *
 * *** REPLACES THE NORMAL RF SPECTRUM PANEL, DOESN'T COEXIST WITH IT
 * *** - see main.c's rtty_scope_active()/rtty_scope_draw(): whenever
 * one of the RTTY-L/RTTY-U modes is selected (k_demod_modes[]/
 * menu_mode_preset_callback()), this panel takes over the same screen
 * area (SPEC_Y/SPEC_H/MAIN_W) the RF spectrum normally uses, and the
 * RF spectrum stops updating entirely for as long as that's the case
 * (main()'s main loop skips sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick() while
 * active - see its own comment for why). Graduated from a
 * debug-build-only tool (the old RTTY_ENABLED build flag) to this
 * permanent mode-based integration on 08/08/2026, once the decoder +
 * scope concept were validated against a real signal.
 */

/*
 * MASTER SWITCH - previously RTTY_ENABLED (build flag); REMOVED
 * 08/08/2026, per the project owner, once the decoder/scope concept
 * was validated against a real signal (see rtty.c's/config.h's
 * comments for that story) and RTTY graduated from "debug-build-only
 * tool" to a real selectable mode - see main.c's k_demod_modes[]
 * (RTTY-L/RTTY-U entries) and menu_mode_preset_callback(). Always
 * compiled in now, exactly like rtty.c/rtty.h always were - see
 * this file's own top comment for the ~10KB static RAM this costs
 * (192KB SRAM total, still comfortable margin as of 08/08/2026, but
 * worth remembering next time RAM gets tight).

/*
 * Multi-window averaging - added 10/08/2026, per the project owner,
 * after noticing SPT (main.c's spatial line-smooth tile) barely
 * affected this panel: SPT smooths across NEIGHBORING COLUMNS within
 * one already-drawn frame, but the visible jitter here was mostly
 * TEMPORAL (frame to frame) - each rtty_scope_poll() used to display
 * a single raw 512-point window completely independent of the last,
 * with no frame-to-frame relationship at all (unlike the main RF
 * spectrum's own sdr_spectrum_waterfall_tick(), which already
 * averages up to SPECTRUM_MAX_FFT_PER_FRAME windows per displayed
 * frame for exactly this reason). Now does the same thing here:
 * rtty_scope_poll() accumulates RTTY_SCOPE_AVG_FRAMES raw windows'
 * power values before a frame is marked ready, so what actually
 * reaches the screen is a real statistical average, not just the
 * latest noisy sample.
 *
 * Trade-off, deliberately chosen with the project owner: this trades
 * away some responsiveness for a calmer trace. Each raw window is
 * RTTY_SCOPE_FFT_SIZE/12000Hz = ~43ms of audio - at
 * RTTY_SCOPE_AVG_FRAMES=3, a displayed frame only updates every
 * ~130ms instead of every ~43ms, so nudging SHIFT with the encoder
 * while watching the two peaks settle takes a little longer to
 * visually converge. 3 was picked as a middle ground (noticeably
 * calmer than 1, without turning the live encoder-tune feel sluggish)
 * - raise it for a calmer trace at the cost of more lag, or drop to 1
 * to fully restore the original every-window behavior.
