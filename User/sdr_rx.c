 * another error. Only a real disable/re-enable of I2SEN forces the
 * whole shifter/frame-counter back to a known state, realigned to

     * (ferr_this_block above). Real hardware logs then showed FERR
     * firing on ~70% of blocks in some WFM sessions (highly variable
     * run to run, 0 to 400+/window, likely genuine hardware timing
     * margin - see aic3204_rate_switch_reset()'s comment for that
     * whole investigation) while the DC-removed I/Q correlation
     * diagnostic kept coming back "inconclusive" or shift=0 for most
     * of those same FERR-flagged blocks - meaning FERR fires far more
     * often than the actual sample data looks bad. Skipping on FERR
     * alone, at a 70% rate, meant the TX buffer almost never got
     * refreshed - reported as complete silence in WFM, which is worse
     * than the noise this was meant to fix. Now does the SAME kind of
     * per-sample wild-jump check rx_capture_looks_corrupted() already
     * uses at lock time (see main.c, RX_LOCK_JUMP_THRESHOLD's comment)
     * but on THIS block, every block, cheaply (plain integer deltas,
     * a few thousand cycles worst case at 512 samples - trivial next
     * to WFM's ~190k/532k cycle budget) - only skips a block that
     * genuinely LOOKS corrupted, regardless of whether FERR happened
     * to be set for it, which should skip far less often and preserve
     * far more real audio.
