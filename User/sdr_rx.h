/*
 * Captures RX samples from the AIC3204 ADC via the MAIN SPI1/I2S1
 * block (PB15=SD), using circular DMA.
 *
 * BLOCK ROLES SWAPPED (28/07/2026): this used to read from the
 * I2S1_ADD extension (PB14) - disassembly of the original firmware's
 * own I2S setup, combined with the GD32F4xx User Manual's DMA request
 * mapping table showing both directions exist as distinct
 * subperipheral options on the same DMA channels, showed the ORIGINAL
 * design uses the MAIN block for RX and the extension for TX - the
 * opposite of what this driver assumed for a long time. See the
 * comments in gd32_i2s.c's gd32_i2s_init_slave_192k() for the full
 * reasoning.
 *
 * DMA mapping: SPI1_RX -> DMA0, Channel 3, PERIEN[2:0]=000
 * (DMA_SUBPERI0). Confirmed against the GD32F4xx User Manual's DMA
 * request mapping table (Table 10-2, "Peripheral requests to DMA0").
 *
 * PING-PONG MODEL: a single circular buffer of 2*(active block size)
 * (stereo, 16-bit). When the DMA finishes the first half (HTF flag),
 * that half is complete and stable while the DMA writes into the
 * second half; when it completes the full circular round (FTF flag),
 * the second half is the one that's ready. sdr_rx_poll_block_iq()
 * tracks this and returns 0 if no new block is ready yet (non-blocking,
 * meant to be called from the main loop like the rest of this project).
