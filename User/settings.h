/*
 * Persistent settings (CONFIG.CSV, alongside CHANNEL.CSV) - built on
 * top of spi_flash.c's confirmed-working FAT12 read/write (17/08/2026:
 * chip identified as Winbond W25Q16, filesystem confirmed FAT12 and
 * confirmed to be the SAME volume the bootloader's USB-MSC mode
 * exposes for update4.bin, write path confirmed both by our own
 * read-back AND by mounting it on a PC after a real write).
 *
 * Format: plain "key,value\n" lines, no quoting/escaping - same
 * spirit as CHANNEL.CSV, and dead simple to parse/generate on a
 * bare-metal MCU without a heap (see settings.c's manual
 * parser/serializer - no sprintf/strtol, same policy as the rest of
 * this project). Unknown keys are silently ignored on load (forward
 * compatible: an older CONFIG.CSV still loads fine after this schema
 * grows); a key missing entirely just leaves that setting at whatever
 * the caller's own default already was.
 *
 * Currently covers: touch calibration (the 7 touch_calibration_t
 * fields - see touch.h), VFO frequency, demod mode, tune step, the
 * AM/SSB audio filter width, speaker volume, and the MS5351 crystal
 * reference frequency (ms5351_xtal_hz - see ms5351_get_xtal_hz()'s
 * comment; applied directly from settings_load(), same "no boot-order
 * dependency" reasoning as touch calibration). Does NOT currently cover memory
 * channels - CHANNEL.CSV already exists for that on this volume (727
 * bytes, format not yet reverse-engineered from this project's code)
 * and deserves its own look before deciding whether to read/write it
 * or keep it separate; out of scope for this first pass.
 *
 * Tune step is stored as its Hz VALUE ("tune_step_hz"), not a raw
 * index into main.c's k_tune_steps[] - main.c looks up which index
 * matches on load, so a future reordering/insertion in that array
 * doesn't silently point an old saved CONFIG.CSV at the wrong step.
 *
 * Persistence policy: NOR flash write cycles are finite (~100k per
 * sector is typical for a W25Q part) - saving on every encoder tick
 * while tuning would burn through that fast for no benefit. See
 * settings_mark_dirty()/settings_poll()'s comments for the debounce
 * this module uses instead.
 */

/* One flag+value pair per optional field - see settings_load()'s
 * comment. Grouped into a struct (rather than a growing list of
 * settings_load() out-parameters) so adding another persisted setting
 * later is one new pair of fields here, not a signature change
 * rippling through every caller. */

 *     for vfo_hz - that settings.c has no business knowing about; see
 *     main()'s boot sequence for exactly where/why each one gets
 *     applied). A have_* flag left at 0 means that key wasn't present
 *     (first boot, or an older CONFIG.CSV from before that key
 *     existed) - the caller's own pre-set default should stand.
