/*
 * Bit-banged transport driver for the external SPI NOR flash chip
 * that SHARES this board's touch-panel bus.
 *
 * PINS (per the project owner, 17/08/2026): CS PB6, SCLK PB3, MISO
 * PB4, MOSI PB5. SCLK/MISO/MOSI are the SAME physical pins touch.c
 * already bit-bangs for the XPT2046 (see touch.h's pin comment) - only
 * the chip-select differs (PB6 here vs PD6 for the touch controller).
 * This is a normal, safe way to put two independent SPI devices on
 * one bus: each has its own CS, and a deselected device (CS held
 * HIGH) ignores whatever SCLK/MOSI does and tri-states MOSI - which
 * both this driver and touch.c are careful to guarantee (CS idles
 * high from init, only goes low for the duration of one transaction).
 * Neither driver needs to know the other exists at the bus-electrical
 * level; they just both have to keep holding up their end of that
 * contract. spi_flash_init() reconfigures PB3/4/5 itself (harmless,
 * idempotent GPIO writes, same mode/speed touch_init() already uses)
 * so this driver doesn't secretly depend on touch_init() having run
 * first - but call order in main() should still put spi_flash_init()
 * AFTER touch_init() so the "who's on this bus" story reads top to
 * bottom for the next person.
 *
 * *** THE BOOTLOADER ALREADY USES THIS CHIP TO STORE update4.bin, IN
 * WHAT'S BELIEVED TO BE A FAT FILESYSTEM - NEITHER HAS BEEN CONFIRMED
 * ON REAL HARDWARE YET ***. Until that confirmation happens, this
 * driver is DELIBERATELY READ-ONLY: JEDEC ID (identifies the chip,
 * standard command across essentially every SPI NOR flash - Winbond/
 * GigaDevice/Macronix/ISSI/...) and a plain byte-range READ. Nothing
 * in this file erases or programs a single byte - see
 * spi_flash_probe_dump()'s comment for the confirmation step that
 * needs to run and be checked against real hardware BEFORE any
 * write/erase support gets added on top of this.
 *
 * Once confirmed, the recommended next step is NOT to hand-roll FAT
 * directory/FAT-table parsing directly against spi_flash_read() - a
 * hand-rolled FAT writer is exactly the kind of thing that silently
 * corrupts an existing volume one untested edge case at a time (a
 * split cluster chain, a long-filename entry, a dirty FAT32 FSInfo
 * sector...). Integrate a real, tested FAT library instead - FatFs is
 * the standard choice for a bare-metal project this size (MIT-
 * licensed, no heap requirement, small footprint, exactly the kind of
 * well-worn dependency this project already leans on for CMSIS-DSP) -
 * via its diskio.c shim calling into this file's
 * spi_flash_read()/a future spi_flash_write_sector(). That keeps this
 * file scoped to just being the SPI transport, and gets the actual
 * FAT correctness from code that's been exercised against real FAT
 * volumes far more than anything written from scratch here could be
 * in a reasonable amount of time.

 * --- WRITE support ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Standard SPI NOR mechanics (true of essentially every 25xx-series
 * chip, this Winbond W25Q16 included): PROGRAM can only clear bits
 * (1->0), never set them - the ONLY way to turn a 0 bit back into a 1
 * is to ERASE, and erase only works on a whole aligned block at a
 * time (4KB here, via the standard 0x20 command). That means you can
 * NEVER safely modify just "the bytes you care about" in place if
 * ANY of them are already non-0xFF (e.g. this volume's existing
 * directory entries and file data, all written long ago) - the whole
 * containing 4KB block has to be read into RAM, modified there, then
 * the WHOLE block erased and reprogrammed. spi_flash_write_block_4k()
 * assumes the caller already has the desired FULL 4KB image ready;
 * spi_flash_block_read_modify_write() does the read+splice step too,
 * and is the one actually safe to call against a block that might
 * already hold real data (e.g. the root directory's block, which also
 * holds CHANNEL.CSV's and SYSTEM~1's entries) - it always preserves
 * whatever else is in that block. spi_flash_sector_erase_4k()/
 * spi_flash_page_program() are exposed too as the raw primitives, for
 * whatever ends up building the actual FAT writer on top.

 *     4096 bytes - plenty for a settings file, not for anything
 *     bigger) and updates BOTH FAT copies to keep them consistent.
 *   - spi_flash_read_file_by_name(): the inverse - finds a file by
 *     its 8.3 name in the root directory's first sector, follows its

 * --- Async (non-blocking) save, fast path only -----------------------
 *
 * Added 18/08/2026: spi_flash_write_or_update_file()'s fast path
 * already cut a save from 6 block erase/program cycles down to 2 (see
 * its comment), but each of those 2 is still a BLOCKING call - the
 * whole main loop (spectrum/waterfall included, though not audio,
 * which is DMA/ISR-driven and unaffected) stalls for however long the
 * flash chip's own internal erase/program circuitry takes, typically
 * tens to a couple hundred ms per 4KB block on a W25Q part - governed
 * by the chip itself, not by how fast bytes are shoved at it, so no
 * amount of transfer-side optimization (DMA included) touches this
 * part of the cost.
 *
 * This spreads the SAME two block operations over many small steps
 * instead, each doing at most one cheap status-register check or one
 * ~4ms page-program transfer - see spi_flash_async_write_block_poll()'s
 * comment for the low-level primitive this is built on. Call
 * spi_flash_async_save_start() once, then spi_flash_async_save_poll()
 * once per main loop iteration until it reports done or error.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to the SAME fast-path preconditions as
 * spi_flash_write_or_update_file() (existing entry, unchanged cluster
 * count) - spi_flash_async_save_start() returns 0 immediately without
 * starting anything if those aren't met (first-ever save of a given
 * file, or a save whose size crosses a cluster-count boundary), and
 * the caller is expected to fall back to the ordinary blocking
 * spi_flash_write_or_update_file() in that case. Only one async save
 * can be in flight at a time (module-global state, matching this
