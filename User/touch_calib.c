 * Lowered from 40 to 20, 18/08/2026: touch_read() treats the

 * CAL_MARGIN px in to cover the FULL screen, extrapolating linearly
 * past the measured points for the outer CAL_MARGIN px on each side.
 * The project owner found a ~3mm (~20px) band along each edge that
 * stayed pinned at a constant 479/799 (touch_debug_stream_poll()
 * showed raw still changing smoothly through that band, only the
 * CALIBRATED output was stuck) - i.e. clamp_u16() saturating because
 * the panel's last few mm aren't quite as linear as the extrapolation
 * assumes, so it "predicts" reaching the edge before the finger
 * actually gets there. A smaller CAL_MARGIN means less distance to
 * extrapolate over in the first place, which should shrink that dead
 * band proportionally - re-run the calibration wizard and check with
 * TOUCH_EDGE_DEBUG (see main.c) whether it did. Some small dead band
 * right at the physical bezel is normal for resistive panels in
 * general (most commercial devices have one too); the goal here is
 * "small enough to not matter", not necessarily zero. Still safely
 * above CAL_CROSS_HALF so the crosshair itself never gets clipped
 * against the screen edge (see draw_crosshair()'s call sites - this

/* --- calibration math ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * See this file's header comment for the full reasoning. Summary:
 *
 *   1. swap_xy: compare how much each raw channel (X and Y) moved
 *      across BOTH horizontal edges - top (TL->TR) and bottom
 *      (BL->BR) - summed together for a steadier signal than a single
 *      edge would give. Whichever channel moved more overall is the
 *      one actually wired to the screen's horizontal axis.
 *
 *   2. Once swap_xy is known, each touch_calibration_t field gets
 *      calibrated from whichever pair of opposite edges its own
 *      hardware channel actually varies along:
 *        - raw_x field: horizontal grouping (left/right edges) if
 *          !swap_xy (raw_x drives screen X), otherwise vertical
 *          grouping (top/bottom edges) - see touch.c's touch_read()
 *          SWAP FIX comment for why the field always describes the
 *          HARDWARE channel, never "whatever ends up as screen x".
 *        - raw_y field: the opposite grouping of raw_x's.
 *      axis_calib_from_group() does the averaging + invert decision
 *      for whichever grouping it's told to use.
